intro_msg: Pioneering Innovation in Genomics to Bridge Discovery and Real-World Impact.
abstract: XinLab, led by Xin Liu (<a href="mailto:liuxin@genomics.cn">liuxin@genomics.cn</a> | <a href="mailto:liuxincqbj@gmail.com">liuxincqbj@gmail.com</a>), is devoted to advancing genomics research and its diverse applications. Since 2009, Xin has been deeply engaged in this challenging yet rewarding field, accumulating a wealth of experience and achieving numerous research milestones. As the ancient Chinese poet Qu Yuan eloquently wrote:<br><br><i><strong>The road is long and winding; I will seek high and low.</strong></i><br><br> Genomics research mirrors this sentiment—it is a long and demanding journey of exploration. Guided by this vision, XinLab remains steadfast in its commitment to innovating genomics technologies and methodologies, developing cutting-edge data analysis approaches, and striving for excellence across multiple omics research domains, including animal, plant, and medical sciences. Our mission extends beyond deepening our understanding of biological phenomena—we actively pursue the practical application and translation of research findings, bridging the gap between discovery and real-world impact.

The research organization model of BGI Research stands apart from traditional universities and research institutions by emphasizing goal-oriented, large-scale projects. Researchers at BGI form teams based on specific project requirements to collaboratively tackle research objectives. While a degree of free exploration is encouraged, the overarching approach leans more toward scientific engineering rather than individual researcher-driven activities. In alignment with this model, XinLab operates differently from conventional laboratories. It centers around the leadership and expertise of <a href="/people/xinliu">Xin Liu</a>, who organizes, integrates, and refines research directions and frameworks to ensure focused progress. Despite this unique structure, XinLab maintains a clear overall positioning (see more details in [Research]({{site.path}}/research)) aligned with BGI Research’s mission: advancing technological innovation, methodological breakthroughs, and practical applications in the genomics field.

As BGI Research continues to grow and Xin Liu's role within BGI evolves (see more details in [About]({{site.path}}/about)), XinLab will adapt and optimize both its research focus and organizational model. At present, XinLab remains dedicated to genomics technology and application research while refining its research directions. The primary focus will center on plant genome evolution, establishing it as a key research priority, while also contributing to multi-omics studies related to clinical applications (see our publications in [Publications]({{site.path}}/publications)). XinLab plans to drive progress in these areas through collaborative efforts with partners, supported by the resources and expertise of BGI Research.

In terms of organizational structure, XinLab comprises not only the BGI Research team directly involved in projects but also a dedicated group of graduate students who participate as "full-time" members (find more details in [People]({{site.path}}/people)). These students primarily focus on plant genome evolution, contributing significantly to the lab's research endeavors. XinLab remains actively engaged in various aspects of BGI Research, including project applications, execution, participation in academic conferences, and mentoring students (find progresses and our thinking in [News]({{site.path}}/news)). This integrated approach ensures both the continuity and depth of its research. Through these efforts, XinLab strives to drive innovation, foster academic exchange, and nurture the next generation of researchers.
