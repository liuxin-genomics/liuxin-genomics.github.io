The spotted sea bass (*Lateolabrax maculatus*) is a commercially valuable fish widely cultivated in China. Despite its importance in aquaculture, genetic studies of this species have been limited, and a high-quality reference genome has been lacking. In our latest study, published in *GigaScience*, we present **the first chromosome-level genome assembly for spotted sea bass**, providing critical insights into **genome structure, evolutionary adaptations, and breeding potential**.

## Key Findings  

- **High-Quality Genome Assembly:**  
  - The assembled genome spans **668 Mb**, with **contig N50 of 31 kb** and **scaffold N50 of 1.04 Mb**.  
  - Hi-C scaffolding enabled the construction of **24 pseudochromosomes**, covering **77.68% of the assembled sequences**.  

- **Phylogenetic Analysis and Evolutionary Insights:**  
  - Using **1,586 single-copy gene families**, we reconstructed a phylogenetic tree confirming that spotted sea bass is **most closely related to European sea bass (*Dicentrarchus labrax*)**, with a divergence time of approximately **87.6 million years ago**.  
  - We identified **125 unique gene families** in spotted sea bass, highlighting lineage-specific genomic adaptations.  

- **Repeat Elements and Gene Annotation:**  
  - A total of **132.38 Mb repeat sequences**, comprising **20.73% of the genome**, were annotated, with **transposable elements making up 17.27% of the genome**.  
  - We identified **22,015 protein-coding genes**, with **96.52% showing homology to known databases**, reinforcing genome completeness and accuracy.  

- **Functional Insights for Aquaculture Improvement:**  
  - Comparative analysis pinpointed **genes linked to osmoregulation**, facilitating the species' ability to thrive in diverse salinity conditions.  
  - The genomic data provides **valuable resources for genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and marker-assisted breeding**, supporting improved economic traits in spotted sea bass aquaculture.  

## Reflections  

After establishing our **Qingdao research branch**, we collaborated with **Professor Changwei Shao and Professor Songlin Chen at the Yellow Sea Fisheries Research Institute** to conduct this **spotted sea bass genome sequencing project**. Our team focused on **sequencing and data analysis**, leveraging advanced genomic technologies to ensure **high-quality assembly**.  

This study represents an important milestone in **marine genomics research**, providing **genetic resources for population genetics, evolutionary studies, and molecular breeding**. By integrating **genome sequencing with applied aquaculture research**, we aim to support **sustainable fisheries and improve breeding efficiency for commercially valuable marine species**.
