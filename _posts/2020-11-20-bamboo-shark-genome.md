Cartilaginous fish, such as sharks, represent an early branch in vertebrate evolution, offering valuable insights into chromosome evolution, immunity, and skeletal development. In our recent study published in *iScience*, we present a **chromosome-level genome assembly of the white-spotted bamboo shark (*Chiloscyllium plagiosum*)**, providing new resources for understanding the genomic dynamics of cartilaginous fish.

## Key Findings

- **High-Quality Genome Assembly:**  
  Using Hi-C chromatin interaction data, we successfully **assembled a 3.85 Gb genome with 51 chromosomes**, offering one of the most complete genomic references for cartilaginous fish.

- **Reconstruction of Ancestral Shark Chromosomes:**  
  By comparing bamboo shark genome data with that of other cartilaginous fish, we **reconstructed 16 ancestral chromosomes** and mapped their evolutionary trajectories. Our analysis revealed a **dynamic chromosome rearrangement process**, with 17 fission and 9 fusion events shaping the bamboo shark genome.

- **Rapidly Evolving Chromosomes and Immune Genes:**  
  Our study identified **13 fast-evolving chromosomes**, enriched in **immune-related genes**, including major histocompatibility complex (MHC) genes and expanded **TRIM gene families**, which are associated with antiviral defense mechanisms.

- **Loss of Bone Formation-Related Genes:**  
  Chromosome rearrangements led to the **loss of three key genes involved in bone formation (p2rx3, p2rx5, and p2rx7)**, reinforcing the **chondrification of the cartilaginous fish skeleton**, a distinctive trait in sharks.

- **Potential Biotechnological Applications of Shark Antibodies:**  
  Bamboo sharks possess **single-domain antibodies (IgNAR)**, which we successfully expressed in a phage display system. These antibodies showed **high affinity for human disease markers**, highlighting their potential use in biomedical applications.

## Reflections

Since establishing our Qingdao branch, **marine genomics has become a key research focus for XinLab**. Leveraging **our sequencing technologies**, we have conducted genomic sequencing across various marine species, and the **bamboo shark genome project** represents one of our most successful initiatives in this field. Unlike some other shark species with highly complex genomes, bamboo shark genomes are **comparatively less difficult to assemble**, allowing us to obtain **high-quality genomic sequences for evolutionary and functional studies**.

Our analyses not only contributed to understanding **chromosome evolution and immune gene expansion in cartilaginous fish** but also provided insights into their **skeletal adaptations**. The **identification of shark-derived single-domain antibodies** presents exciting possibilities for **biotechnological and pharmaceutical applications**, further bridging evolutionary genomics with biomedical research. Moving forward, **our team is expanding marine genomics projects**, continuing to explore the genomes of additional cartilaginous species.
