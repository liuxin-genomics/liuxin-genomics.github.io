Soybean (*Glycine max*) is a critical crop globally, serving as a major source of protein and oil. Understanding its genetic diversity and domestication history is essential for improving breeding strategies and ensuring agricultural sustainability. In our latest study, published in *Nature Genetics*, we conducted **whole-genome resequencing of 31 soybean accessions**—including **17 wild and 14 cultivated varieties**—to explore **genetic variation, linkage disequilibrium patterns, and domestication bottlenecks**.

## Key Findings  

- **Genome-Wide SNP and Genetic Diversity Analysis:**  
  - A total of **6.3 million single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)** were identified across all accessions.  
  - Wild soybeans exhibited **higher genetic diversity (π = 2.97 × 10⁻³)** compared to cultivated varieties **(π = 1.89 × 10⁻³)**, confirming genetic bottlenecks during domestication.  

- **Linkage Disequilibrium (LD) and Selection Events:**  
  - Soybeans exhibited **exceptionally high LD**, with cultivated varieties showing an average LD decay distance of **150 kb**, making marker-assisted breeding more feasible.  
  - Selective sweeps were detected in **369 genomic regions**, highlighting **key loci associated with domestication traits like seed shattering and plant architecture**.  

- **Introgression and Evolutionary Insights:**  
  - Genomic comparisons revealed **recent introgression of wild soybean alleles into cultivated lines**, supporting natural genetic exchange.  
  - A **4.5-Mb inversion on chromosome 10** was detected, potentially influencing agronomic traits related to biomass accumulation and vitamin E content.  

## Reflections  

This was my **first genomics research project**, conducted in collaboration with **Professor Hon-Ming Lam at The Chinese University of Hong Kong**. We efficiently **completed the whole-genome sequencing and data analysis for 31 soybean accessions**, gaining valuable insights into **soybean genetic diversity and domestication history**. The peer-review process was relatively smooth, and this project provided **an invaluable learning experience in navigating the full research cycle—from sequencing to publication**.
