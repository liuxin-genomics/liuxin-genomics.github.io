Panax notoginseng (*P. notoginseng*), a medicinal herb with significant economic and therapeutic value, has long been studied for its active compounds, particularly **ginsenosides**, which provide numerous pharmacological benefits. In our latest study, published in *iScience*, we present a **chromosome-level genome assembly** of *P. notoginseng*, offering critical insights into **genome evolution, ginsenoside biosynthesis, and agronomic trait associations**.

## Key Findings  

- **High-Quality Genome Assembly:**  
  Using **Nanopore, PacBio, and Hi-C sequencing**, we generated a **2.24 Gb genome assembly**, achieving superior contiguity compared to previous assemblies.  
  This assembly **anchors 88.89% of sequences onto 12 chromosomes**, significantly improving reference genome accuracy for genetic studies.  

- **Panax-Specific Whole-Genome Duplications (WGDs):**  
  Comparative analysis with *Panax ginseng* and *Daucus carota* revealed that **two lineage-specific WGDs** contributed to genome expansion, alongside transposable element (TE) proliferation.  

- **Ginsenoside Biosynthesis Pathway Genes Identified:**  
  We annotated key genes involved in **ginsenoside production**, including **CYP716 and UGT genes**, which play a role in the biosynthetic pathway.  

- **Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS) for Agronomic Traits:**  
  - *63 genes associated with dry root weight*  
  - *168 genes linked to stem thickness*  
  - *Several candidate genes potentially contributing to disease resistance*  
  These findings provide valuable genetic markers for **breeding programs** aimed at improving medicinal plant yield and resilience.  

## Reflections  

Guangyi Fan is an invaluable member of our team, now leading **marine genomics research** at **BGI-Qingdao**. Before transitioning into this field, his primary focus was **plant genomics**, contributing to a range of genome assembly projects.  

An opportunity arose when we connected with **Professor Simon Lee at the University of Macau**, leading to a collaborative research initiative that extended beyond genomic studies into **talent development**. Thanks to **Guangyi’s efficient coordination**, we successfully secured **research funding**, launched **scientific projects**, and strengthened **training programs**.  

The University of Macau’s **Chinese medicine research** is one of the most advanced in the country, making it the ideal partner for our **Panax notoginseng genome project**, which also served as part of Guangyi Fan’s **doctoral research**. Through this collaboration, we not only **enhanced our understanding of ginsenoside biosynthesis** but also **bridged plant genomics with medical applications**, underscoring the broader impact of genomic research in traditional medicine.
