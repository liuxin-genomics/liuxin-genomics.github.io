The Siamese fighting fish (*Betta splendens*) is well known for its **highly aggressive behavior**, making it a valuable model species for studying the genetic basis of aggression and behavioral traits in teleost fish. However, the absence of a **high-quality reference genome** has previously hindered deeper genetic and evolutionary studies. In our latest publication, released in *GigaScience*, we present the **first chromosome-level genome assembly of *B. splendens***, providing essential genomic resources for comparative research and behavioral genetics.

## Key Findings  

- **High-Quality Genome Assembly:**  
  - The assembled genome spans **465.24 Mb**, with **N50 scaffold size of 949.03 Kb**.  
  - Using **Hi-C sequencing**, we successfully **anchored 93% of the assembled sequences** onto 21 chromosomes, offering a more complete and structured genome reference.  

- **Comparative Genomics and Chromosome Conservation:**  
  - Chromosomal mapping between *B. splendens* and *Oryzias latipes* revealed **strong chromosome conservation**, alongside **rearrangement events in three chromosomes**.  
  - We annotated **23,981 protein-coding genes**, supported by RNA sequencing data from multiple tissues (brain, liver, muscle, heart).  

- **Genetic Basis of Aggression:**  
  - Whole-genome resequencing of **five different *B. splendens* varieties** allowed us to detect **3.4 million single-nucleotide variations (SNVs) and 27,305 insertions/deletions (indels)**.  
  - Gene family expansions in **NLRP3 (inflammation response), TRIM47 (stress regulation), and AVPR2 (vasopressin receptor)** were identified, potentially contributing to **aggression-related behaviors**.  

## Reflections  

This study was conducted in collaboration with **Professor Simon Leeâ€™s team at the University of Macau**, as part of our broader genomic research initiatives. Our team led the sequencing and data analysis efforts, leveraging **high-throughput genomic technologies** to establish a foundational reference for **behavioral genetics in teleost fish**. This project serves as an important step toward **exploring genomic mechanisms underlying aggression**, providing valuable data for **comparative genomics and evolutionary studies**.
