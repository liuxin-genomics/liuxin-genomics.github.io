The Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin (*Sousa chinensis*) is a coastal cetacean species facing increasing threats due to habitat loss, pollution, and human activities. In our latest study, published in *iScience*, we present **a chromosome-level genome assembly for the Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin**, providing new insights into cetacean chromosome evolution and population genetics, supporting conservation efforts for this vulnerable species.

## Key Findings

- **Chromosome Evolution and Structural Rearrangements:**  
  By reconstructing the ancestral cetacean genome, we identified **key chromosome reshuffling events**, including fusions, translocations, and breakpoints, which influenced genes related to kidney filtration, body development, and immunity.

- **Genetic Diversity and Population Structure:**  
  Whole-genome resequencing of individuals from **two neighboring populations in the South China Sea (Leizhou Bay and Sanniang Bay)** revealed **low genetic diversity and moderate population differentiation**, alongside a severe **bottleneck occurring ~4,000 years ago**.

- **Conservation Implications:**  
  Effective population sizes have dramatically declined, emphasizing the **high risk of extinction** and the urgent need for conservation actions to prevent further genetic erosion.

## Reflections  

Since establishing **XinLabâ€™s Qingdao branch**, marine genomics has become a central research focus. This study marks an important milestone in our efforts to apply genomics in **marine species conservation**, helping us understand the **chromosomal evolution and population dynamics of Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins**.  

Collaborating with **local and international research teams**, we successfully integrated **genome sequencing, comparative genomics, and ecological data** to support conservation strategies. As habitat destruction and environmental changes increasingly threaten marine biodiversity, we hope our research can **aid in developing informed conservation policies**. Moving forward, we aim to continue expanding **marine mammal genomics research**, improving our understanding of cetacean evolution and conservation genetics.
