As one of the most ancient living plants, **Ginkgo biloba** has survived for over 200 million years, maintaining its resilience through dramatic environmental changes. In our latest study, published in *Nature Communications*, we present **genome-wide resequencing of 545 ginkgo trees sampled across 51 global populations**, offering unprecedented insights into **ginkgo's evolutionary history, population dynamics, and adaptations**.

## Key Findings  

- **Identification of Three Refugia in China:**  
  Our study confirmed that ginkgo populations persisted in **three refugia—Southwestern, Southern, and Eastern China—during Pleistocene glaciations**. Genetic analyses revealed **four ancient genetic components**, with populations in Northern China arising from admixture between Southern and Southwestern lineages.

- **Anthropogenic Influence on Ginkgo Dispersal:**  
  Phylogenetic and genetic analyses demonstrated **multiple human-mediated introductions of ginkgo from Eastern China to Japan, Korea, Europe, and North America**, supporting the hypothesis that people played a key role in the species' global resurgence.

- **Climatic Adaptation and Resilience:**  
  Using **species distribution modeling (SDM)**, we reconstructed ginkgo's habitat shifts across historical climate events, showing **northward expansion after the last glacial maximum (LGM)**. Bioclimatic factors such as **temperature seasonality and precipitation patterns** were identified as key drivers of ginkgo's distribution.

- **Natural Selection and Genetic Adaptation:**  
  Genome-wide scans uncovered **genes associated with stress tolerance, fungal resistance, and extreme weather adaptation**, underscoring ginkgo's ability to survive harsh environmental conditions.

## Reflections  

This project was initiated as part of **a large-scale genome study leveraging our newly developed DNBSEQ sequencing platform**. Professor **Song Ge** and **Dean Xun Xu** envisioned an ambitious effort to sequence **high-quality plant genomes at scale**, collaborating with **Professor Yun-Peng Zhao from Zhejiang University**, a leading expert in plant research. Given ginkgo's **historical, cultural, and scientific significance as a gymnosperm**, we recognized the value of conducting **a comprehensive population genomics study**.  

With a genome size of approximately **10 Gb**, sequencing **hundreds of individual trees** posed **massive data generation and analysis challenges**. Overcoming these hurdles, we successfully completed the study, delivering **valuable insights into ginkgo’s evolutionary and ecological dynamics**. Beyond this publication, our extensive dataset allowed us to **identify sex chromosomes, revealing an XY-based sex determination system in ginkgo**. This finding is particularly exciting, as sex determination mechanisms in plants—especially ancient lineages like ginkgo—remain a **fascinating subject for evolutionary biology**.  

Although our initial sex-determination study was not accepted alongside this work, we expanded our dataset by **sequencing and assembling additional ginkgo genomes**, refining our analysis of **sex determination regions**. We look forward to publishing these findings soon, further advancing our understanding of plant genetics and evolution.
