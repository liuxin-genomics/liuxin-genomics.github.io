Most fruits consumed today are the result of long-term domestication and breeding efforts. However, the genetic basis underlying domestication traits and population diversity remains largely unexplored in several fruit crops. In our latest study, published in *Nature Genetics*, we present **a genome-wide variation map of cucumber**, generated through deep resequencing of **115 cucumber lines sampled from 3,342 accessions worldwide**. Our findings offer **new perspectives on cucumber domestication, trait selection, and genomic diversity**, providing valuable insights for future breeding programs.

## Key Findings  

- **Comprehensive Genome-Wide Variation Analysis:**  
  - **Deep resequencing of 115 cucumber lines** revealed **~3.6 million genetic variants**, including **3,305,010 SNPs, 336,081 small indels, and 594 presence-absence variations (PAVs)**.  
  - Comparative analysis with the **wild cucumber genome (Cucumis sativus var. hardwickii)** identified **21,021 orthologous genes**, helping to refine the evolutionary history of cucumber.  

- **Domestication Bottlenecks in Fruit vs. Grain Crops:**  
  - Cucumber underwent a **much narrower population bottleneck** during domestication compared to grain crops like **rice and maize**, leading to a **greater loss of genetic diversity**.  
  - The estimated **effective population size at domestication was ~500**, which is significantly lower than that of maize (~150,000) and rice (~1,300).  

- **Identification of Domestication Sweeps:**  
  - A total of **112 domestication sweep regions** were detected, spanning **7.8% of the genome (15.4 Mb)** and **affecting 2,054 genes**.  
  - Notably, one of these regions contains a gene associated with the **loss of fruit bitterness**, a critical trait selected during cucumber domestication.  

- **Natural Genetic Variation for Nutritional Improvement:**  
  - The study identified **a natural genetic variant in a β-carotene hydroxylase gene (CsaBCH1)** responsible for **β-carotene accumulation in Xishuangbanna cucumbers**.  
  - This discovery opens new possibilities for breeding **cucumbers with enhanced nutritional value**, particularly varieties rich in provitamin A.  

## Reflections  

Collaborating with **Professor Sanwen Huang on this project was an incredibly rewarding experience**, as I gained **a deeper understanding of cucumber history and cultivation practices**. Additionally, I learned **how to efficiently drive large-scale genomics projects forward**, which proved invaluable for future research. Alongside **Peng Zeng**, I was responsible for **data analysis**, and the insights we uncovered significantly advanced **our knowledge of cucumber domestication and genetic diversity**.
