Pearl-producing mollusks have long been recognized as economically valuable species, not only for their exquisite pearls but also for their role in aquaculture and marine biology research. Understanding the genetic foundation of these species is essential for improving pearl cultivation, conservation, and biomineralization studies. In our latest study, published in *GigaScience*, we present **a high-quality genome assembly of *Pinctada fucata martensii***, shedding light on **the genetic mechanisms underlying biomineralization, pearl formation, and shell structure development**.

## Key Findings  

- **Chromosome-Level Genome Assembly:**  
  - The assembled genome spans **990.66 Mb**, with **86.5% of scaffolds anchored to 14 linkage groups**.  
  - Achieved a **contig N50 size of 21 kb** and a **scaffold N50 of 324 kb**, significantly improving previous molluscan genomic references.  

- **Biomineralization Gene Expansions:**  
  - Identified **novel proteins involved in nacre formation**, including **chitin synthases (CHS) and von Willebrand factor A-containing proteins (VWAPs)**.  
  - These genetic components share similarities with **vertebrate bone matrix proteins**, highlighting potential evolutionary connections.  

- **Genome-Wide Expression Patterns:**  
  - Transcriptomic analysis across **11 tissues and 12 developmental stages** revealed dynamic gene regulation during **shell and pearl formation**.  
  - Found extensive expression of **tyrosinase genes**, known to **influence shell pigmentation and structural integrity**.  

- **Economic Trait Analysis and Aquaculture Applications:**  
  - Comparative genomic studies with **other bivalves identified key genes linked to pearl size, growth rate, and shell durability**.  
  - This study provides a **valuable genetic foundation** for **marker-assisted selection and aquaculture breeding strategies**.  

## Reflections  

Pearl-producing mollusks have long been recognized as valuable economic species. In this study, we conducted genome sequencing on a widely cultivated species, working alongside our research collaborators to analyze **genes associated with economically significant traits**.  

This research represents **an important advancement in pearl oyster genomics**, providing **new insights into biomineralization and pearl cultivation**. By integrating **genomic sequencing, transcriptomics, and proteomics**, we explored **the molecular basis of shell and pearl formation**, offering **potential applications for improving aquaculture practices**.
