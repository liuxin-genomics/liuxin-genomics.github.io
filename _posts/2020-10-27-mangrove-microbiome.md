Mangrove ecosystems are unique coastal environments that support diverse microbial communities, playing a crucial role in nutrient cycling and environmental resilience. In our latest study, published in *mSystems*, we investigated **the microbial taxonomic and functional shifts in two distinct mangrove ecosystems in southern China**, uncovering their potential for bioactive compound production and antibiotic resistance.

## Key Findings  

- **Microbial Diversity Across Pristine and Anthropogenic Mangroves:**  
  Using **deep shotgun metagenomic sequencing**, we constructed a **gene catalog of 87 million unique genes**, revealing significant differences in microbial composition between **pristine mangroves (Guangxi) and anthropogenic mangroves (Shenzhen)**.  
  - **Nitrospira and ammonia-oxidizing archaea** were more abundant in **Shenzhen mangroves**, indicating enhanced nitrogen metabolism.  
  - **Sulfate-reducing bacteria and methanogens** dominated **Guangxi mangroves**, reflecting their role in sulfur metabolism and methane production.  

- **Functional Genomics and Metabolic Pathways:**  
  The functional analysis confirmed that **Shenzhen mangrove microbiomes** exhibited a higher abundance of **nitrogen metabolism genes**, while **Guangxi mangroves** showed a greater capacity for **sulfur metabolism and methanogenesis**.  

- **Discovery of Biosynthetic Gene Clusters (BGCs):**  
  Hundreds of **de novo reconstructed microbial genomes** revealed **novel biosynthetic potential**, including three **high-quality Acidobacteria genomes** enriched with **bioactive compound-producing gene clusters**.  

- **Antibiotic Resistance in Mangrove Microbiomes:**  
  A total of **67,278 unique genes** were annotated with **antibiotic resistance functions**, highlighting the **prevalence of multidrug-resistant genes** in mangrove microbial communities.  

## Reflections  

This study comprehensively explores **the taxonomy and functionality of mangrove microbiomes**, shedding light on their **biogeochemical roles and potential for bioactive compound discovery**. The research was led by **Shuilin Liao and Yayu Wang**, with contributions from **Xin Liu and collaborators at Xiamen University**.  

Mangrove ecosystems are often overlooked in microbial genomics, yet they harbor **rich genetic resources with implications for environmental sustainability and biotechnology**. By integrating **metagenomics and functional analysis**, we provide a valuable foundation for **future studies on microbial adaptation, secondary metabolite biosynthesis, and antibiotic resistance in coastal environments**.
