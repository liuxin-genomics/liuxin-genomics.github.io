Foxtail millet (*Setaria italica*) is a drought-tolerant crop with rich nutritional value and historical significance, domesticated in China over 8,700 years ago. As one of the **most resilient cereal grains**, it serves as a model for biofuel research and plant evolution studies. Despite its economic and ecological importance, a comprehensive genome reference had been lacking. In our latest study, published in *Nature Biotechnology*, we present **the first high-quality genome assembly of foxtail millet**, uncovering key genetic traits linked to **chromosomal evolution, drought adaptation, and biofuel potential**.

## Key Findings  

- **Genome Assembly and Annotation:**  
  - The **423 Mb draft genome** was successfully anchored onto **nine chromosomes**, covering approximately **86% of the estimated genome size**.  
  - A total of **38,801 protein-coding genes** were identified, with **81% showing expression activity across different tissues**.  

- **Evolutionary Insights and Chromosomal Rearrangements:**  
  - Comparative genomic analysis with **rice and sorghum** revealed **three major chromosomal reshuffling events**, highlighting key divergence points in grass evolution.  
  - Foxtail millet was found to share an ancestral whole-genome duplication (WGD) event dating **~70 million years ago**, before its split from sorghum and maize.  

- **Functional Genomics and Key Trait Mapping:**  
  - Genes related to **C4 photosynthesis**, an efficient carbon fixation pathway, were studied, providing insight into its role in **enhancing drought resistance and biomass productivity**.  
  - **Sethoxydim-resistance mapping** successfully pinpointed genetic variations linked to herbicide tolerance, reinforcing foxtail millet’s potential for **sustainable agriculture**.  

## Reflections  

BGI’s agricultural research division has long recognized **foxtail millet as an essential model crop**, not only because it was **domesticated in China** and remains widely cultivated here, but also because of its **exceptional drought tolerance and nutritional advantages**. While its **lower yield** has historically limited commercial expansion, its genetic traits hold **tremendous potential for biofuel applications and stress-resilient crop development**.  

This study represents an important milestone in **plant genome research**, marking **the successful construction of a foxtail millet reference genome and trait mapping analysis**. Our research team **worked in parallel with an international group**, and both studies on foxtail millet genomics were published simultaneously. By integrating **high-throughput sequencing technologies with applied genomics**, we aim to accelerate **crop improvement, conservation, and sustainability efforts**.
