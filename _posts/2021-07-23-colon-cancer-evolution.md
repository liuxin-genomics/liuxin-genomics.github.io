Tumor evolution is a dynamic and complex process, with variations in growth patterns significantly influencing disease progression and therapeutic outcomes. In our latest study, published in *iScience*, we utilized **high-depth whole-exome sequencing (WES) of 206 tumor regions** from 68 colorectal cancer (CRC) patients to unravel **intratumor heterogeneity (ITH) and clonal evolution** across different tumor locations—right-sided colon cancer (RCC), left-sided colon cancer (LCC), and rectal cancer (RC). By integrating **evolutionary insights with genetic evidence**, we analyzed metastasis pathways involving **lymph nodes (LN) and extranodal tumor deposits (ENTDs)**, revealing distinct patterns of tumor development.

## Key Findings

- **Distinct Evolutionary Pathways Between RCC, LCC, and RC:**  
  Our study found **higher complexity and divergence in LCC and RC tumors** compared to RCC. Through phylogenetic tree analysis, we observed **more branched evolution** in LCC and RC, suggesting increased genetic variability and adaptability.

- **Tumor Metastasis and Polyclonality:**  
  While **LN and ENTDs were previously assumed to share common origins**, our findings demonstrate that **both metastases originated from different clones**. Moreover, ENTD evolved **later than LN metastases**, providing an essential distinction for future TNM staging classifications.

- **Genetic Signatures and Key Driver Events:**  
  Mutational analysis revealed **higher intratumor heterogeneity (ITH) in RC**, with fewer clonal mutations compared to RCC. Key tumor-driver genes, including **APC, TP53, and KRAS**, were confirmed as early events in tumor initiation, while **SMAD4 alterations** were predominantly detected in metastatic lesions.

- **Parallel Evolution and Tumor Progression:**  
  By detecting **mirrored subclonal allelic imbalance (MSAI) events**, we identified cases of **parallel evolution**, highlighting **convergent mutational pathways** that influence CRC progression.

## Reflections

Morphogenesis is a fundamental biological process, with **symmetry forming the basis of most structural development**. However, asymmetry—especially subtle variations in bilaterally symmetrical organs—often emerges. In disease pathology, such asymmetry can **amplify critical differences**, providing a unique lens through which tumor progression and abnormal growth can be examined.

Many past studies have demonstrated that **asymmetric tumor development** can be an invaluable tool in **identifying key factors that drive disease onset and progression**, particularly within similar genetic backgrounds. By systematically investigating the evolutionary divergence among CRC subtypes and mapping out **genetic variations linked to tumor asymmetry**, we take a crucial step toward refining precision medicine approaches.

This study was led by **Santasree Banerjee**, a key member of our disease research group in **Qingdao**, and exemplifies our commitment to **unraveling the genomic complexities of cancer evolution** through collaborative, high-resolution sequencing strategies.
