The black rockfish (*Sebastes schlegelii*) is a teleost species that exhibits **viviparity**, a reproductive strategy in which eggs are fertilized internally and retained within the maternal reproductive system until live birth occurs. Unlike most teleosts that lay eggs externally, black rockfish undergo **internal fertilization, sperm storage, and extended embryonic development**. In our latest study, published in *Molecular Ecology Resources*, we present **a chromosome-level genome assembly of black rockfish**, providing critical insights into the genetic mechanisms underlying **viviparity and reproductive adaptation in nonmammalian vertebrates**.

## Key Findings  

- **High-Quality Genome Assembly:**  
  We successfully **assembled the black rockfish genome** using **PacBio long-read sequencing and Hi-C scaffolding**, achieving a **contig N50 of 3.85 Mb** and anchoring **99.86% of sequences onto 24 chromosomes**.  

- **Genomic Basis of Sperm Storage and Release:**  
  Through transcriptomic and ATAC-seq analyses, we identified **zona pellucida (ZP) proteins**, which play a crucial role in **retaining sperm at the oocyte envelope until fertilization occurs**. Additionally, we discovered **astacin metalloproteinase subfamilies**, which facilitate **sperm release and embryo hatching**.  

- **Maternal Preparation for Embryonic Development:**  
  Our analysis revealed genes associated with **vascularization, blood vessel formation, neuroglobin expression, and calcium-sensing receptors**, suggesting that the **ovarian wall of black rockfish functions similarly to the mammalian uterus**, supporting embryo implantation and growth.  

- **Evolutionary Insights into Viviparity:**  
  Comparative genomic analysis showed that black rockfish **diverged from its egg-laying relatives approximately 84.9 million years ago**, providing evolutionary context for the emergence of **viviparity in teleost fishes**.
