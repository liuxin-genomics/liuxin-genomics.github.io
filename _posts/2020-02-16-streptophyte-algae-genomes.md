The transition of plants from aquatic to terrestrial environments represents a pivotal moment in evolutionary history. While land plants (embryophytes) are well studied, their closest algal relatives—the streptophyte algae—provide crucial insights into this transformation. In our latest study, published in *Nature Plants*, we present **the genome assemblies of Mesostigma viride and Chlorokybus atmophyticus**, two of the earliest-diverging streptophyte algae. These genomes offer a unique perspective on how ancestral plants adapted to subaerial environments before the emergence of land plants.

## Key Findings

- **Genomic Traits Linked to Terrestrial Adaptation:**  
  Comparative genomics revealed that the **common ancestor of streptophytes already possessed genetic features suited for terrestrial environments**. These include **phytochrome-based light sensing, embryophyte-like photorespiration, stress-response transcription factors, and cellulose synthesis pathways** that are typical of land plants.

- **Divergent Genome Evolution in Freshwater vs. Terrestrial Algae:**  
  Mesostigma viride, a freshwater alga, shows evidence of **genomic streamlining**, including the loss of certain terrestrial-adaptation genes. Meanwhile, Chlorokybus atmophyticus, which thrives in subaerial environments, retained **key genetic elements for survival in harsh terrestrial conditions**.

- **Functional Insights from Phytohormones and Transcription Factors:**  
  The genomes highlight **early gains in plant hormone signaling components** such as **cytokinin and abscisic acid (ABA)**, which are crucial for stress adaptation. Importantly, **multiple transcription factor families involved in environmental responses** also originated in early streptophytes.

## Reflections  

In 2017, we launched the **10,000 Plant Genomes Project (10KP)**, aiming to sequence representative species across major plant branches, with a particular focus on **reference genome assembly and comparative analysis**. Algae hold an important place in this initiative, and our team collaborated with **Professor Michael Melkonian from the University of Cologne** to investigate significant algal genomes. This research represents one of our major achievements in the study of plant evolution.

Personally, I find algae fascinating—not just because they offer insights into terrestrial adaptation, but because they bridge evolutionary gaps in plant biology. Our team member **Sibo Wang** made crucial contributions to this project, helping drive forward data analysis and genome assembly. As we continue expanding the **genomic landscape of algae**, I am excited about the possibilities of unlocking further evolutionary mysteries that link aquatic ancestors to terrestrial plants.
