We’re thrilled to announce that XinLab has published a new paper in *GigaScience* (2025, Vol. 14) titled **“Exploring the Cellular and Molecular Basis of Murine Cardiac Development through Spatiotemporal Transcriptome Sequencing.”** Led by [Xin Liu](/people/xinliu) and [Jizheng Wang](https://fuwaihospital.org), with contributions from Jingmin Kang, Qingsong Li, and others, this study marks a significant step forward in understanding heart development and regeneration.

#### Why It Matters

The heart is a complex organ, and unlocking the secrets of its development could pave the way for new treatments for heart disease. Mice are unique because their hearts can regenerate shortly after birth, unlike humans. By studying this process, we aim to uncover mechanisms that could one day inspire regenerative therapies. Our study uses cutting-edge **Stereo-seq** technology to map gene expression across developing mouse hearts, revealing how cells and molecules change over time.

#### Key Findings

Using spatial transcriptomics, we created a **comprehensive atlas** of mouse heart development at four time points: embryonic day 20 (E20), postnatal day 1 (P01), day 4 (P04), and day 14 (P14). Here’s what we discovered:

- **Cellular Landscape**: Identified 14 distinct cell types, with ventricular cardiomyocytes (57%) and atrial cardiomyocytes (21%) dominating. Over time, ventricular cells increased, while atrial cells and fibroblasts decreased.
- **Cell Interactions**: Found that cell-cell interactions weaken as the heart matures, linked to reduced signals like collagen and insulin-like growth factor, potentially tied to loss of regeneration.
- **Regeneration Insights**: Pinpointed genes like *Igf2* and transcription factor *Plagl1* as key players in early heart regeneration, validated by quantitative PCR. These could be targets for future research.
- **Atrial Asymmetry**: Uncovered genes like *Pitx2* and *Bmp10* driving left-right atrial differences, critical for heart function.

#### The XinLab Connection

This study reflects XinLab’s mission to push the boundaries of computational biology and cardiology. [Xin Liu](/people/xinliu), the study’s senior author, guided the team in leveraging spatial omics to map the heart’s molecular dynamics. Jingmin Kang and Qingsong Li played pivotal roles in data analysis and experiments, collaborating with experts like [Jizheng Wang](https://fuwaihospital.org) from Fuwai Hospital.
