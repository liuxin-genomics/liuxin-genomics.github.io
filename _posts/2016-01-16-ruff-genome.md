The ruff (*Philomachus pugnax*) is a migratory wading bird with one of the most complex and fascinating mating systems in the animal kingdom. Males exist in three distinct morphs—**independents, satellites, and faeders**—each differing in **behavior, plumage, and body size**. In our latest study, published in *Nature Genetics*, we investigate the **genetic basis underlying these alternative reproductive strategies**, revealing **a 4.5-Mb inversion associated with dominant Satellite and Faeder morphs**.

## Key Findings  

- **High-Quality Genome Assembly**  
  - We generated a **1.23 Gb genome assembly** using Illumina sequencing with **N50 scaffold size of 10 Mb**.  
  - The ruff genome was **compared against other birds** to identify conserved synteny and evolutionary divergence.  

- **Discovery of a Large Chromosomal Inversion**  
  - A **4.5-Mb inversion** was detected on **scaffold 28**, perfectly correlating with **Satellite and Faeder phenotypes**.  
  - This inversion occurred **~3.8 million years ago**, with a **rare recombination event creating the Satellite chromosome ~500,000 years ago**.  

- **Genetic Basis of Male Morphs**  
  - Gene analysis identified **missense mutations in MC1R**, explaining **plumage differences among morphs**.  
  - Structural changes around **HSD17B2 and SDR42E1**, both involved in **sex hormone metabolism**, were linked to **behavioral differences** between morphs.  

- **Evolutionary Implications**  
  - The accumulation of **genetic changes within the inversion** over time has resulted in **a striking example of how structural variation drives phenotypic diversity**.  
  - This work supports the broader concept of **supergenes controlling complex traits**, similar to findings in **white-throated sparrows and butterfly mimicry genes**.  

## Reflections  

This research was conducted **in collaboration with Professor Leif Andersson at Uppsala University** and highlights **how genomic analysis can uncover mutations tightly linked to behavioral differences in animals**. While the ruff is well known in Europe, it has received **limited cultural attention in China**, making this study particularly unique in its scope.  

Unlike plant genome research—where functional validation is often required—**animal genome studies thrive on evolutionary storytelling**. The ruff serves as **a powerful example of how genetic variation shapes social behavior and reproductive strategies**, reinforcing **the importance of structural genomic changes in species adaptation**.
