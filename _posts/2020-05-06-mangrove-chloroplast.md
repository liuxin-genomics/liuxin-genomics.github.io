Mangrove ecosystems serve as critical environmental buffers between land and sea, hosting unique plant species that have adapted to extreme coastal conditions. Despite their ecological importance, the **chloroplast genomes of mangrove species remain largely unexplored**. In our latest study, published in *BioMed Research International*, we present **complete chloroplast genome assemblies of 14 mangrove species** across six taxonomic orders, providing an in-depth comparative analysis of their genomic features and evolutionary adaptations.

## Key Findings  

- **Chloroplast Genome Assembly and Structure:**  
  The assembled **chloroplast genomes range from 149 kb to 168 kb**, exhibiting a conserved structure of **two inverted repeats (IRs), one large single-copy (LSC), and one short single-copy (SSC) region**. Most genes remain highly conserved, with only **four genes showing signs of positive selection**.  

- **Phylogenetic Insights from Chloroplast DNA:**  
  Using **44 conserved genes across 71 plant species**, we reconstructed the phylogenetic relationships of mangroves within the broader rosid and asterid clades. The tree confirmed the **classification of obscure families in Malpighiales** and refined the evolutionary positioning of mangrove species in relation to terrestrial plants.  

- **Divergence and Molecular Evolution:**  
  Comparative genomic analyses revealed that **chloroplast IR regions exhibit the lowest genetic divergence**, indicating evolutionary stability. Additionally, **simple sequence repeats (SSRs) were found to be highly variable**, suggesting their potential use as genetic markers for population studies.  

## Reflections  

This project is part of our **funded research on mangrove symbiotic microbiomes** and represents a significant step in **XinLab’s environmental genomics initiatives**. The research also forms part of the doctoral dissertation of **Chengcheng Shi**, who has contributed extensively to comparative genomic analyses in this study.  

The exploration of **mangrove chloroplast genomes** aligns with our broader effort to understand **how plants adapt to extreme environments** and how **symbiotic microorganisms contribute to their survival**. Working alongside **Professor Simon Lee’s team at the University of Macau**, we integrated sequencing and bioinformatic approaches to construct **high-resolution genomic data**, further enriching our knowledge of mangrove phylogeny and molecular evolution.
