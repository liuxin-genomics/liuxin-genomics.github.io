Lettuce (*Lactuca sativa*) is one of the most widely consumed leafy vegetables in the world, yet its genetic diversity and domestication history have remained largely unexplored. In our recent study, published in *Nature Genetics*, we performed **whole-genome resequencing of 445 Lactuca accessions** collected globally, providing a comprehensive genetic variation map for lettuce. These findings offer valuable insights into lettuce evolution, domestication, and potential applications in crop breeding.

## Key Findings

- **Reconstructing the Domestication History of Lettuce:**  
  Using **phylogenetic and demographic analyses**, we traced the origins of cultivated lettuce to the **Caucasus region**, where initial domestication was marked by the loss of seed shattering. Subsequent cultivation efforts in **Southern Europe** refined leaf morphology, leading to modern lettuce varieties.

- **Genetic Diversity and Structural Variations:**  
  Our sequencing efforts identified **179 million SNPs, 30 million insertions/deletions (indels), and 244,866 structural variants** across wild and cultivated lettuce species. This data provides an unprecedented look into **how genetic differentiation shaped modern lettuce traits**.

- **Resistance Clusters and Wild Introgression:**  
  Analysis of **major resistance clusters (MRCs)** within the lettuce genome revealed extensive **wild introgression**, specifically from *L. serriola*, which contributed disease-resistance genes used in breeding for downy mildew resistance.

- **Implications for Lettuce Breeding and Crop Improvement:**  
  With a **detailed genetic blueprint**, this study offers breeders a **powerful resource for improving lettuce varieties**, enabling **enhanced disease resistance, stress tolerance, and yield optimization**.

## Reflections

After establishing collaborations with our **Dutch partners**, we worked to advance both **genomic sequencing** and **phenotypic characterization** of lettuce. Our collaborators had already collected a global diversity panel of lettuce varieties, and after thorough discussions, we selected representative samples for sequencing. Addressing logistics, we successfully transported the samples to **BGI-Shenzhen** for genome sequencing.

Additionally, we recognized the importance of **conducting field trials outside of Europe** to examine environmental effects on plant traits. Leveraging **BGI’s agricultural base in Laos**, we initiated **lettuce germplasm cultivation**, collecting phenotypic data over two years—ultimately driving this publication to completion.

This study represents only the beginning of our research into **global lettuce populations**. A **larger-scale sequencing project**, involving nearly **all known lettuce varieties**, is already in progress. **Wei Tong**, from BGI Research, played a pivotal role in managing **international collaborations, sample coordination, data analysis, and manuscript development**—helping bring this project to fruition.
