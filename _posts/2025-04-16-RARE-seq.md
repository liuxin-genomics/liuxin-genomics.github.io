# Sensitively detect cfRNA - RARE-seq

## ✨ Methodological Innovations

### 🔬 Optimized cfRNA Analysis Workflow  
RARE-seq is a refined method for cfRNA analysis, encompassing the entire workflow—from plasma sample processing, cfRNA extraction, and library preparation to high-throughput sequencing. This method is designed to significantly enhance the sensitivity of ctRNA detection.  

### 🩸 Addressing Platelet Contamination  
For the first time, RARE-seq reveals the substantial impact of platelet contamination on cfRNA analysis. A computational approach was developed to effectively remove platelet RNA interference, ensuring more accurate detection of non-platelet-derived gene expression.  

### 🎯 Targeted Capture of Low-Abundance Genes  
Innovatively designed to target and capture rare or absent transcripts (RAGs) in healthy individuals’ plasma, RARE-seq facilitates efficient detection of genes originating from non-hematopoietic tissues—providing a powerful tool for identifying cancer-specific and organ-specific genes.  

## 🚀 Technical Advantages

### 🔍 High Sensitivity  
Compared to traditional whole-transcriptome RNA sequencing, RARE-seq enhances sensitivity in detecting tumor-derived cfRNA by **approximately 50-fold**, with a detection limit as low as **0.05%**. This allows for the identification of minuscule amounts of tumor-related cfRNA in the bloodstream with remarkable precision.  

### 🎯 Exceptional Specificity  
RARE-seq effectively distinguishes tumor-derived cfRNA from background cfRNA, reducing false-positive results and improving detection accuracy.  

### 🛠 Robust Noise Resistance  
By optimizing experimental procedures and computational methods, RARE-seq successfully eliminates platelet contamination and background noise, enhancing signal clarity and result reliability.  

### 🔬 Broad Applicability  
RARE-seq is not limited to cancer detection—it also shows promising potential in **tissue origin identification**, **therapy resistance monitoring**, and **evaluation of non-malignant diseases**.  

## 🔑 Key Findings

### 🧪 Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) Detection  
Among **437 plasma samples**, RARE-seq efficiently detects NSCLC transcriptional signatures. Detection sensitivity increases with tumor progression, reaching **83% sensitivity** and **95% specificity** in stage IV patients—outperforming initial circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) analysis.  

### 📌 Tissue Origin Identification  
Analysis of pancreatic, prostate, and liver cancer patients validates RARE-seq’s effectiveness across multiple cancer types. With an **89% accuracy rate**, it provides a powerful tool for determining the tissue origin of malignancies.  

### 🔬 Therapy Resistance Monitoring  
In NSCLC patients harboring **EGFR mutations**, RARE-seq successfully detects histological transformations and mutation-based resistance mechanisms, equipping clinicians with a more comprehensive understanding of therapy resistance.  

### 🩺 Non-Malignant Disease Assessment  
RARE-seq identifies lung-derived cfRNA expression in patients with **chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)**, **active COVID-19 infection**, and **intensive care unit (ICU) admissions**, demonstrating its potential for assessing non-malignant lung conditions.  

## 💡 Clinical Applications

### 🔎 Early Cancer Screening  
With its high sensitivity, RARE-seq holds promise for **early cancer detection**, particularly for small tumors that are challenging to identify through conventional imaging methods.  

### 🏥 Tissue Origin Identification  
For patients with **unknown primary tumors** or those requiring cancer subtype differentiation, RARE-seq enables non-invasive tumor tissue identification—enhancing clinical diagnostic precision.  

### 💊 Therapy Monitoring & Prognostic Evaluation  
By tracking ctRNA changes in real-time, RARE-seq facilitates the early detection of therapy resistance mechanisms, allowing for timely **adjustments to personalized treatment plans**.  

### 🩺 Non-Malignant Disease Assessment  
RARE-seq aids in monitoring **tissue damage and inflammation**, evaluating **disease activity**, and **treatment response**—offering a new perspective for diagnosing and managing non-malignant diseases.  

### 🦠 RNA Vaccine Tracking  
RARE-seq enables simultaneous tracking of **vaccine RNA** and **host immune response** in individuals vaccinated with mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines, providing valuable insights for RNA vaccine development and application.
