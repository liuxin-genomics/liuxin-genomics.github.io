Marine mammals offer unique evolutionary models, demonstrating adaptations to aquatic environments through physiological and genetic modifications. Among them, the **sperm whale (*Physeter macrocephalus*)**, one of the deepest-diving marine mammals, has fascinated scientists with its extreme physiological capabilities. In our latest study, published in *Molecular Ecology Resources*, we present **the first chromosome-level genome assembly of sperm whale**, leveraging data generated from **our high-throughput sequencing platform BGISEQ-500** to investigate **chromosomal evolution, repeat content, gene family dynamics, and genetic adaptations in marine environments**.  

## Key Findings  

- **High-Quality Chromosome-Level Genome Assembly:**  
  - We successfully **assembled the sperm whale genome** using **BGISEQ-500 sequencing, 10X Genomics, and Hi-C scaffolding**, achieving a **scaffold N50 of 121.90 Mb**, with **94.34% of sequences anchored onto 21 chromosomes**.  
  - Comparative analysis demonstrated **high genome continuity**, aligning **99.29% of the Gulf of Mexico sperm whale assembly** to our reference genome, **resolving gaps and repetitive regions more effectively**.  

- **Chromosome Evolution and Structural Rearrangements:**  
  - By reconstructing ancestral chromosomes, we traced **major interchromosomal rearrangements** distinguishing sperm whales from terrestrial relatives such as cattle, detecting **fission and fusion events unique to cetacean evolution**.  
  - Gene expansions linked to **hypoxia adaptation, oxygen conservation, and deep-diving capabilities** were identified, shedding light on **the genetic basis of sperm whale physiology**.  

- **Marine Adaptation and Positive Selection:**  
  - Functional enrichment analysis revealed **positively selected genes (PSGs) involved in oxygen transport, stress resistance, and metabolic adaptations**, highlighting genetic pathways supporting **long-duration dives and extreme depth tolerances**.  
  - The study confirmed **gene family contractions in immune-related pathways**, indicating **unique pathogen resistance mechanisms adapted to marine environments**.  

## Reflections  

After launching **our proprietary high-throughput sequencing platform**, we aimed to showcase its capabilities by **conducting genome sequencing and assembly on a representative species**, much like our previous **giant panda genome project**. The **sperm whale genome project** embodies this effort, leveraging **BGISEQ-500 data for assembly**. Given that the sperm whale is a **mammal**, genome assembly was **relatively successful**, delivering **high-resolution chromosome-level insights**. However, **compared to assemblies relying on long-read sequencing technologies, the results still have some limitations**, which remain a challenge for future improvements in genome assembly strategies.
