To diversify global food supplies and enhance nutrition security, underutilized crops—often referred to as **orphan crops**—offer an essential path forward. Unlike major staple crops such as wheat, rice, and maize, these species remain largely overlooked in modern breeding programs despite their **economic, nutritional, and environmental significance**. In our latest study, published in *GigaScience*, we present **draft genome assemblies for five African orphan crops**, shedding light on their genetic diversity and potential for agricultural improvement.  

## Key Findings  

- **Genome Sequencing and Assembly of Five Species:**  
  We successfully sequenced and assembled the genomes of:
  - **Vigna subterranea** (*Bambara groundnut*): A drought-tolerant legume rich in protein and carbohydrates.  
  - **Lablab purpureus** (*Hyacinth bean*): A multipurpose legume with nitrogen-fixing abilities.  
  - **Faidherbia albida** (*Apple-ring acacia*): A nitrogen-fixing agroforestry tree adapted to arid regions.  
  - **Sclerocarya birrea** (*Marula*): A fruit-bearing tree with nutritional and medicinal applications.  
  - **Moringa oleifera** (*Moringa*): A fast-growing tree known for its leaves’ high protein and antioxidant content.  

- **Gene Annotation and Functional Insights:**  
  The gene annotations provided **high-resolution insights into starch biosynthesis, transcription factor evolution, and nitrogen fixation pathways**.  
  - *Vigna subterranea* exhibited **expanded starch metabolism genes**, potentially contributing to its **high resistant starch content**.  
  - *Faidherbia albida* showed **unique adaptations for root nodule symbiosis**, facilitating its nitrogen-fixing capability.  
  - Comparative genomic analysis uncovered **gene families involved in stress resistance, fruit development, and metabolic regulation**, providing valuable targets for breeding improvements.  

- **Phylogenetic Analysis and Evolutionary Divergence:**  
  Using **single-copy genes**, we constructed a phylogenetic tree, estimating the evolutionary divergence times between these orphan crops and related species.  
  - *Moringa oleifera* diverged from *Carica papaya* approximately **65 million years ago**, while *Faidherbia albida* separated from other legumes **79 million years ago**.  
  - Gene family expansion and contraction analyses revealed **adaptive genomic features linked to environmental resilience**.  

## Reflections  

This research is part of the **African Orphan Crop Genome Initiative**, which we launched in **2015**, aiming to systematically **sequence and analyze orphan crops that play crucial roles in African agriculture and food security**. The project was conducted in **collaboration with UC Davis and the African Orphan Crop Consortium (AOCC)**, with sample contributions from **ICRAF (World Agroforestry Centre)**. By leveraging **high-throughput sequencing technologies**, we successfully **assembled genome references for five key crops**, contributing essential genetic insights for **future breeding, conservation, and agricultural development**.  

Moving forward, our efforts will continue to **expand genomic resources for underrepresented crops**, supporting **sustainable agriculture and improving food security** through **genomics-driven plant breeding**.
