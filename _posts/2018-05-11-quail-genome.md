The Japanese quail (*Coturnix japonica*) is a poultry species with significant agricultural and scientific value. As a model organism for avian genetics, its rapid maturation and distinct genetic traits make it ideal for studying domestication and evolutionary processes. In our latest study, published in *GigaScience*, we present **a chromosome-level genome assembly and population genomic analysis of Japanese quail**, shedding light on **genetic diversity, domestication history, and key traits related to breeding selection**.  

## Key Findings  

- **High-Quality Genome Assembly:**  
  - We generated a **1.04 Gb genome assembly**, with **86.6% of sequences anchored to 30 chromosomes** (28 autosomes and 2 sex chromosomes Z/W).  
  - Comparative analysis with chicken and turkey genomes revealed **phylogenetic relationships within the Phasianidae family**, clarifying a long-standing debate over evolutionary divergence.  

- **Genetic Basis of Early Maturation:**  
  - The study identified **four genes under positive selection associated with rapid sexual maturation in quail**, including *FSHB*, a hormone gene influencing reproductive timing.  
  - Comparative hormonal analysis showed **higher levels of follicle-stimulating hormone beta (FSHB) in quail**, correlating with their accelerated growth and reproductive cycle.  

- **Population Genomics and Selective Sweeps:**  
  - Genome-wide resequencing of **31 quail samples** (wild, egg-type, and meat-type) revealed **distinct selective sweep regions in domesticated lines**, supporting the hypothesis of **independent selection processes for egg-laying and meat production traits**.  
  - A **1.8 Mb sweep region on chromosome Z** was linked to plumage color, providing a valuable genetic marker for breeding programs.  

- **Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS) for Plumage Color:**  
  - GWAS identified **a haplotype block on chromosome Z** strongly associated with **maroon/yellow plumage variation** in domesticated quail.  
  - The study pinpointed *CCDC171* as a key candidate gene, diverging from the previously known *TYRP1* pigmentation gene found in other avian species.  

## Reflections  

This project was conducted in collaboration with the **Hubei Academy of Agricultural Science**, where our team primarily contributed to **high-throughput sequencing and genomic data analysis**. By leveraging **large-scale sequencing techniques**, we successfully **assembled and analyzed the quail genome**, uncovering important genetic patterns related to **domestication, selection, and evolutionary processes**. These findings provide essential resources for **genetic improvement in quail breeding**, with broader implications for poultry genomics.
