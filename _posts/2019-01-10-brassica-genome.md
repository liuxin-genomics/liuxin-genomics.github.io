Brassica species are essential for agriculture and evolutionary studies, with genomes shaped by polyploidization events and extensive structural variations. In our latest study, published in *Plant Molecular Biology*, we present a **chromosome-length genome assembly of *Brassica nigra*** and a **comparative analysis of Brassica chromosomes**, shedding light on evolutionary divergence and structural variations.  

## Key Findings  

- **High-Quality *Brassica nigra* Genome Assembly:**  
  Using **Hi-C sequencing**, we generated an **assembly of 484 Mb, with 393 Mb anchored onto 8 chromosomes**, improving previous references with higher resolution and gene annotation accuracy.  

- **Comparative Analysis of B Genomes in Mustard Species:**  
  - The assembled *B. nigra* genome was compared with the **B subgenome of *B. juncea***, revealing **significant chromosomal variations post-polyploidization**.  
  - Regions with major variations exhibited **lower gene density and higher transposable element (TE) content**, reinforcing the role of genome architecture in shaping species divergence.  

- **Evolutionary Insights into Brassica Chromosome Differentiation:**  
  - Comparative chromosome mapping of **Brassica A, B, and C genomes** demonstrated that **A genome remains closer to their common ancestor**, while **C genome underwent more structural variations after divergence**.  
  - Identified **orthologous regions across three Brassica diploids**, refining our understanding of **chromosome evolution and genomic plasticity in Brassica species**.  

## Reflections  

I first met **Wenliang Wang** when I joined **BGI**, and over the years, he has proven to be a dedicated expert in bioinformatics. This research formed the basis of **his doctoral dissertation** and was carried out in collaboration with **our partners in Wuhan**.  

This project was initiated with a vision to **leverage newly developed sequencing platforms** for large-scale genome studies, and *Brassica nigra*—an essential but often underrepresented species—was selected for **population genomic research**. With **its 10 Gb genome size**, conducting **resequencing and assembly** posed significant computational challenges, requiring **advanced scaffolding techniques** such as **Hi-C mapping**. Overcoming these technical hurdles, we successfully **refined genome assembly and evolutionary analysis**, offering valuable resources for **Brassica genomics and breeding applications**.
