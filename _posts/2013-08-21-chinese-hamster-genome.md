Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells are the preferred production hosts for **biopharmaceuticals**, widely used for the development of **therapeutic proteins, antibodies, and hormones**. However, the genetic heterogeneity among CHO cell lines has posed challenges for systematic study and engineering. In our latest study, published in *Nature Biotechnology*, we present **a 2.4-Gb draft genome assembly of the Chinese hamster (*Cricetulus griseus*)**, alongside comparative analyses of six CHO cell lines. This research provides **a unifying genomic reference** for CHO-based bioprocessing and highlights key **mutational differences affecting cellular function and protein production**.  

## Key Findings  

- **Chinese Hamster Genome Assembly and Annotation:**  
  - We assembled **a high-quality 2.4-Gb reference genome**, identifying **24,044 genes**, which serve as a baseline for CHO studies.  
  - Optical mapping and transcriptome sequencing confirmed **high sequence accuracy**, improving gene annotations and regulatory element identification.  

- **Comparative Genomics Across CHO Cell Lines:**  
  - Resequencing of **six CHO cell lines** uncovered **>3.7 million SNPs, 551,240 small insertions/deletions (indels), and 7,063 copy number variations (CNVs)**.  
  - Several **functional gene deletions** were detected, including in **apoptosis-regulating genes**, which influence cell survival during bioprocessing.  

- **Metabolic Pathways and Genetic Adaptations for Biopharmaceutical Production:**  
  - We identified key **glycosylation pathway genes**, essential for **therapeutic protein stability and activity**, providing insights into CHO cell line engineering.  
  - Apoptosis-related gene expression shifts were observed, with **anti-apoptotic pathways significantly upregulated in CHO cells**, supporting **high-density cell culture viability**.  

## Reflections  

This project was carried out in collaboration with **UC San Diego**, focusing on genome assembly and comparative analysis between **Chinese hamster and CHO cell lines**. Our research partners are experts in **biopharmaceutical engineering**, with deep expertise in drug-related genes and pathways. The metabolic pathway figures in this paper are particularly striking, visually illustrating key biochemical interactions critical to **CHO-based therapeutic production**.
