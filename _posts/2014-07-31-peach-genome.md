Peach (*Prunus persica*) is one of the most economically and culturally significant fruit crops, with a long history of domestication dating back thousands of years. As a **perennial fruit crop**, its genetic evolution differs from annual plants, leading to unique selection pressures and domestication patterns. In our latest study, published in *Genome Biology*, we conducted **large-scale resequencing of 84 peach accessions**, unveiling critical insights into its **genetic diversity, domestication history, and human influences on perennial fruit crops**.

## Key Findings  

- **Whole-Genome Resequencing of Peach Populations:**  
  - A total of **10 wild and 74 cultivated peach varieties**, including **9 ornamental, 23 breeding, and 42 landrace lines**, were sequenced.  
  - Identified **4.6 million single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)**, revealing genetic variations responsible for key traits such as **fruit size, flavor, and flower morphology**.

- **Single Domestication Event and Population Structure:**  
  - Phylogenetic analyses showed that **modern cultivated peach** originated from **a single domestication event**, diverging from wild peach species.  
  - Ornamental and edible peach varieties belong to **the same genetic lineage**, alongside geographically distinct populations of *Prunus ferganensis*.  

- **Genes Under Selection in Edible and Ornamental Peach:**  
  - Identified **147 genes under artificial selection** related to **fruit quality, sugar metabolism, and growth traits** in **edible peaches**.  
  - Found **262 genes linked to floral development, pigmentation, and branching patterns**, shaping the evolution of **ornamental peaches**.  

- **Impact of Human Cultivation on Peach Evolution:**  
  - Artificial selection and **clonal propagation** led to **a decline in genetic heterozygosity** over time.  
  - Comparative analysis of heterozygosity ratios confirmed **a sharp reduction in genetic diversity**, influenced by selective breeding practices.

## Reflections  

This project was conducted in collaboration with the **Zhengzhou Fruit Research Institute**, focusing on **population resequencing analysis of peach varieties**. Our team was responsible for **sequencing and genomic data analysis**, enabling **a deeper understanding of peach domestication and genetic diversity**. The results of this study not only enhance our knowledge of **perennial fruit crop evolution** but also provide **valuable genetic resources for future breeding programs**.
