Sex chromosome evolution is one of the most fascinating processes in genomic research, with profound implications for understanding genetic differentiation and adaptation. In our recent study, published in *Molecular Biology and Evolution*, we assembled **chromosome-level genomes for both male and female spotted knifejaw (*Oplegnathus punctatus*)**, a marine fish species with a unique **X1X2Y sex chromosome system**. This work provides a detailed reconstruction of **neo-Y chromosome formation and its evolutionary trajectory**, contributing valuable knowledge to sex chromosome research.

## Key Findings

- **Genome Assembly and Sex Chromosome Structure:**  
  Using **PacBio long-read sequencing, Nanopore sequencing, and Hi-C scaffolding**, we generated high-contiguity genome assemblies for both sexes. The **male genome spans 831 Mb**, while the **female genome is 764 Mb**, closely aligning with cytogenetic observations. Crucially, our assembly includes the **full-length sequences of all three sex chromosomes (X1, X2, and neo-Y), enabling an unprecedented evolutionary analysis**.

- **Evolutionary History of the Neo-Y Chromosome:**  
  Through comparative analysis, we reconstructed the formation of the neo-Y chromosome, showing that:  
  - A large **chromosomal inversion** occurred **~55 million years ago**, suppressing recombination in an ancestral Y chromosome.
  - A subsequent **Robertsonian translocation fused the ancestral Y with an autosome**, forming the neo-Y chromosome **~48 million years ago**.
  - Despite its old age, the **neo-Y exhibits only moderate genetic degeneration**, retaining a significant proportion of functional genes.

- **Functional Gene Annotation and Sex-Specific Expression:**  
  Transcriptomic profiling of gonads revealed **87 male-biased genes** on the sex chromosomes, including **key genes involved in spermatogenesis**. These findings suggest **positive selection for male-beneficial genes**, influencing the genetic structure of the neo-Y chromosome.

## Reflections

This project marks an important milestone for our genomic research in Qingdao. Following the establishment of **BGI-Qingdao**, we actively developed long-term collaborations with **local research institutions**, strengthening joint efforts in **genome sequencing and evolutionary genomics**. This partnership has allowed us to **accelerate project funding applications and streamline scientific publications**, paving the way for more extensive studies in marine genomics.

As we analyzed the evolution of the neo-Y chromosome, I was struck by the complexity and **unique trajectory of sex chromosome differentiation in teleost fish**. Unlike classical mammalian sex chromosomes, the **spotted knifejawâ€™s system demonstrates a prolonged yet incomplete degeneration process**, offering rare insights into how genetic recombination, inversion events, and translocations shape sex chromosome evolution. With the **foundation of this study in place**, our team looks forward to exploring **more species with unusual sex-determination systems**, further advancing comparative genomics research.
