Jackfruit (*Artocarpus heterophyllus*) and breadfruit (*Artocarpus altilis*) are two economically and nutritionally significant species within the *Artocarpus* genus. As staple food crops in tropical regions, their genomic characteristics play a crucial role in understanding their **high starch and sugar content**, as well as potential applications in food security and crop improvement. In our latest study, published in *Genes*, we present **high-quality draft genome assemblies of jackfruit and breadfruit**, offering new insights into their metabolism and evolutionary adaptations.

## Key Findings  

- **Genome Assembly and Annotation:**  
  - A total of **273 Gb and 227 Gb of sequencing data** was generated for jackfruit and breadfruit, respectively.  
  - The jackfruit genome was assembled into **162,440 scaffolds totaling 982 Mb**, while the breadfruit genome comprised **180,971 scaffolds totaling 833 Mb**.  
  - Gene annotation identified **35,858 protein-coding genes in jackfruit and 34,010 in breadfruit**, including pathways associated with starch and sucrose metabolism.  

- **Expansion of Starch and Sugar Metabolism Genes:**  
  - Comparative analysis revealed **expansion of gene families** related to **starch biosynthesis and sugar metabolism**, highlighting their distinct fruit composition.  
  - Tissue-specific expression analysis showed variation in **UGD1 and starch biosynthesis genes**, possibly explaining differences in starch accumulation.  

- **Evolutionary Insights from *Artocarpus* Genomes:**  
  - Phylogenetic analysis confirmed that *Artocarpus heterophyllus* and *Artocarpus altilis* are closely related to **mulberry (*Morus notabilis*)** rather than jujube (*Ziziphus jujuba*).  
  - Whole-genome duplication (WGD) analysis suggested that **a shared genome duplication event occurred between 62 and 10 million years ago** in both species.  

## Reflections  

This research is **part of our collaboration with UC Davis and the African Orphan Crop Consortium (AOCC)**, conducted with **sample contributions from ICRAF**. The genome sequencing and analysis were led by **Bo Song**, who efficiently coordinated the project and drove its completion.  

As part of **broader efforts to sequence underrepresented crops**, our team aimed to **uncover the genetic basis of starch and sugar metabolism**, providing valuable insights for **plant breeders and agricultural researchers**. Additionally, beyond this study, we are further exploring **sex-determination mechanisms in Artocarpus species**, which remain a fascinating subject in evolutionary plant biology.
