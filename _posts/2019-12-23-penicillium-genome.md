Mangrove ecosystems host a diverse range of microorganisms, including fungi that play a crucial role in organic matter decomposition and secondary metabolite production. Among them, *Penicillium variabile* is a widespread ascomycetous fungus known for its ability to produce bioactive compounds with pharmaceutical potential. In our latest study, published in *Journal of Fungi*, we present the **first chromosome-level genome assembly** of *P. variabile* HXQ-H-1, a strain isolated from mangrove sediments along the coast of Fujian Province, China.

## Key Findings  

- **High-Quality Genome Assembly:**  
  - The assembled genome spans **33.32 Mb**, with a **scaffold N50 of 5.23 Mb** and **contig N50 of 96.74 kb**.  
  - Approximately **95.91% of the assembly sequences were anchored** into seven longest scaffolds, providing a reliable genomic reference for further studies.  

- **Functional Genome Annotation:**  
  - A total of **10,622 protein-coding genes** were identified, with **99.66% of them annotated across eight functional databases**.  
  - Key biosynthetic gene clusters involved in **polyketide synthase (PKS), non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS), and terpene synthesis** were found, highlighting the strainâ€™s biotechnological potential.  

- **Comparative Genomics and Phylogenetics:**  
  - Comparison with *Talaromyces islandicus* showed HXQ-H-1 has a slightly higher gene count, with enriched functional categories related to **signal transduction, secondary metabolite biosynthesis, and energy metabolism**.  
  - A genome-wide phylogenetic analysis confirmed that HXQ-H-1 is **closely related to *T. islandicus***, further refining the classification of Penicillium and Talaromyces fungi.  

## Reflections  

This research is part of **our ongoing effort to explore fungal biodiversity in mangrove ecosystems**, an area rich in untapped microbial diversity with significant ecological and biotechnological implications. The project was led by **Ling Peng and Liangwei Li**, with contributions from our broader research team, including **Chengcheng Shi and Guangyi Fan**.  

This study represents an important milestone in **fungal genomics**, not only providing a high-resolution genomic reference for *Penicillium variabile*, but also paving the way for **bioprospecting novel bioactive compounds and understanding fungal adaptations in mangrove environments**. Moving forward, we aim to further investigate **the functional roles of secondary metabolites and their potential applications in medicine and industry**.
