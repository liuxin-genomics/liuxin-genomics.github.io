Rice (*Oryza sativa*) is a staple food crop that has undergone extensive domestication, resulting in significant phenotypic and physiological changes. Understanding the genetic variation between cultivated and wild rice is key to identifying **valuable agronomic traits**, optimizing **breeding strategies**, and improving **crop yield and stress resilience**. In our latest study, published in *Nature Biotechnology*, we **resequenced 50 rice accessions**, covering **40 cultivated and 10 wild varieties**, generating a **high-density single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) dataset** to uncover candidate genes selected during domestication.

## Key Findings  

- **Genome-Wide Variation Analysis:**  
  - Resequencing efforts yielded **6.5 million high-quality SNPs**, providing the most comprehensive variation dataset for rice genome research.  
  - Comparative analysis between cultivated and wild rice identified **genomic regions with significantly reduced diversity**, suggesting human-driven selection events.

- **Domestication and Population Structure:**  
  - Phylogenetic analyses confirmed **independent domestication pathways for indica and japonica rice**, aligning with wild ancestors *O. nivara* and *O. rufipogon*, respectively.  
  - Principal component analysis (PCA) and neighbor-joining trees highlighted **clear genetic differentiation** between rice subspecies, reinforcing **distinct evolutionary trajectories**.

- **Candidate Genes Under Selection:**  
  - We detected **739 selective sweep regions in japonica and 750 in indica rice**, pinpointing genes related to **plant architecture, flowering, and stress tolerance**.  
  - Key domestication genes such as **prog1** (growth regulation) and **sh4** (seed shattering suppression) were successfully identified.  

- **Applications for Rice Breeding and Genetic Improvement:**  
  - Genome-wide SNP markers serve as an essential tool for **marker-assisted selection**, enabling breeders to **develop high-yield, stress-resistant rice varieties**.  
  - Functional annotation of candidate genes highlights **potential targets for improving grain quality, disease resistance, and abiotic stress tolerance**.  

## Reflections  

When I took over this project, it had already undergone **an initial round of peer review at *Nature*** and was undergoing major revisions. These included **increasing sequencing depth** and **expanding sample selection with additional individuals for re-sequencing**. Ultimately, we analyzed **50 rice varieties**, alongside **15 additional varieties sequenced at lower depths**, making this study one of the **larger-scale population genomic analyses in rice research**. Despite the challenges of revision and refinement, the final publication in *Nature Biotechnology* represents a significant contribution to **rice genomics and crop improvement**.
