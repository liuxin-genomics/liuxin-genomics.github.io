The African eggplant (*Solanum aethiopicum*) is a vital crop cultivated across tropical Africa for its nutritional and medicinal value. Despite its significance, limited genomic resources have slowed breeding progress compared to other Solanaceae relatives. In our recent study, published in *GigaScience*, we present **a high-quality draft genome of *S. aethiopicum***, offering new insights into **disease resistance, drought tolerance, and evolutionary mechanisms** within orphan crops.  

## Key Findings  

- **High-Quality Genome Assembly and Annotation:**  
  - We generated a **1.02 Gb draft genome**, revealing a **78.9% repeat-rich structure**.  
  - A total of **37,681 gene models** were annotated, including **34,906 protein-coding genes**.  

- **LTR Retrotransposon Amplifications in Disease Resistance Genes:**  
  - Two major bursts of **long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposon** amplification (~1.25 and 3.5 million years ago) contributed to the **expansion of disease resistance genes**.  
  - These insertions facilitated **resistance to pathogens like Fusarium, Ralstonia, and Verticillium**, making *S. aethiopicum* an ideal genetic reservoir for crop improvement.  

- **Resequencing and Pan-Genome Construction:**  
  - Genome-wide resequencing of **65 accessions (including *S. anguivi*, its wild ancestor)** identified **18.6 million SNPs**, with **34,171 SNPs linked to disease resistance genes**.  
  - The **pan-genome included 51,351 genes**, uncovering **7,069 genes absent from the reference genome**, broadening genetic resources for breeding initiatives.  

- **Domestication and Adaptive Evolution:**  
  - Our study **traced domestication patterns** within the Gilo and Shum groups, identifying **active selection in drought-resistance genes** and **environmental adaptation mechanisms**.  
  - Population genetics revealed a **bottleneck event ~4,000-5,000 years ago**, followed by rapid population expansion, likely influenced by human cultivation.  

## Reflections  

This research is **part of the African Orphan Crop Consortium (AOCC) initiative**, conducted in collaboration with **UC Davis and ICRAF**. The partnership provided essential sample resources, while our team led the **genome sequencing and analysis**. The project was efficiently driven by **Bo Song**, whose leadership ensured smooth execution and high-quality data production.  

Following this successful study, Bo Song later transitioned to the **Shenzhen Institute of Genomics at the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences**, where he continues his impactful work in plant genomics. This project exemplifies how **advancing genomic research in orphan crops can enhance agricultural sustainability**, improve **breeding efficiency**, and contribute to global food security.
