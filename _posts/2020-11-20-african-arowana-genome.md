The evolutionary history of teleosts is deeply intertwined with continental drift, shaping their genetic diversity and adaptations. In our latest study, published in *iScience*, we present **a chromosome-level genome assembly of the African arowana (*Heterotis niloticus*)**, alongside comparative analyses with its relatives, the pirarucu (*Arapaima gigas*) and Asian arowana (*Scleropages formosus*). This work provides critical insights into the genomic evolution of Osteoglossidae and the impact of biogeographical events on teleost diversification.  

## Key Findings  

- **Genome Assembly and Evolutionary Insights:**  
  Utilizing **stLFR, Nanopore, and Hi-C sequencing**, we achieved a **highly contiguous genome assembly of 669 Mb**, anchored to 20 chromosomes. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that African arowana diverged from Asian arowana **~106.1 million years ago**, coinciding with the final separation of Africa and South America.  

- **Dynamic Genome Evolution:**  
  African arowana exhibited a **faster evolutionary rate and higher pseudogenization** compared to Asian arowana, reflecting its adaptation to new ecological niches. Additionally, we observed **more transposable element insertions in Asian arowana**, contributing to **gene duplications and genome expansion**.  

- **Genetic Mechanisms Underlying Dietary Transition:**  
  Unlike its carnivorous relatives, the African arowana transitioned to **an omnivorous diet**, with a noticeable **contraction of olfactory receptor genes** and **expansion of UGT genes** involved in metabolismâ€”suggesting genomic adaptations linked to feeding behavior changes.  

## Reflections  

This project was **part of our broader genomic research on Osteoglossiformes** and was conducted in collaboration with **Professor Li-Zhi Gao and our team members**, including **Xin Liu**, who contributed extensively to data analysis and interpretation. Given the **economic and ecological significance of arowana species**, this study provides valuable genomic resources for both evolutionary biology and aquaculture improvements.  

Through **long-term collaborations and advanced sequencing techniques**, we continue to uncover **the genetic basis of teleost adaptation, speciation, and evolutionary history**. As we expand our work in **fish genomics**, we aim to integrate **comparative genomics with functional studies**, further exploring **the molecular evolution of aquatic species**.
