Abstract: Lampreys are early jawless vertebrates that are the key to understanding the evolution of vertebrates. However, the lack of cytomic studies on multiple lamprey organs has hindered progress in this field. Therefore, the present study constructed a comprehensive cell atlas comprising 604,460 cells/nuclei and 70 cell types from 14 lamprey tissue samples. Comparison of cellular evolution across species revealed that most lamprey cell types are homologous to those in jawed vertebrates. We discovered acinar- and islet-like cell populations despite the lack of parenchymal organs in lampreys, providing evidence of pancreatic function in vertebrates. Furthermore, we investigated the heterogeneity of lamprey immune cell populations. Natterin was highly expressed in granulocytes, and NATTERIN was localized to the lipid droplets. Moreover, we developed a transgenic mouse model expressing Natterin to elucidate the role of NATTERIN in lipid metabolism, whereas the browning of white adipose tissue was induced. These findings elucidate vertebrate cellular evolution and advance our understanding of adipose tissue plasticity and metabolic regulation in lampreys.

Abstract: Background Spatial transcriptomics is a powerful tool that integrates molecular data with spatial information, thereby facilitating a deeper comprehension of tissue morphology and cellular interactions. In our study, we utilized cutting-edge spatial transcriptome sequencing technology to explore the development of the mouse heart and construct a comprehensive spatiotemporal cell atlas of early murine cardiac development.Results Through the analysis of this atlas, we elucidated the spatial organization of cardiac cellular lineages and their interactions during the developmental process. Notably, we observed dynamic changes in gene expression within fibroblasts and cardiomyocytes. Moreover, we identified critical genes, such as Igf2, H19, and Tcap, as well as transcription factors Tcf12 and Plagl1, which may be associated with the loss of myocardial regeneration ability during early heart development. In addition, we successfully identified marker genes, like Adamts8 and Bmp10, that can distinguish between the left and right atria.Conclusion Our study provides novel insights into murine cardiac development and offers a valuable resource for future investigations in the field of heart research, highlighting the significance of spatial transcriptomics in understanding the complex processes of organ development.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Heliconia, a genus within the Zingiberales order, is renowned for its diverse morphology, suggesting a rich genetic reservoir. However, genetic research on plants within the Heliconiaceae family has primarily focused on taxonomy and phylogenetics, with limited exploration into other genetic aspects, particularly the chloroplast genome. Given the significance of chloroplast genomes in evolutionary studies, a deeper understanding of their structure and diversity within Heliconia is essential. METHODS: In this study, we sequenced and assembled the complete chloroplast genomes of four representative Heliconia species: Heliconia bihai, Heliconia caribaea, Heliconia orthotricha, and Heliconia tortuosa. The chloroplast genomes were analyzed for structure, gene content, and nucleotide diversity. We also performed comparative analysis with other species within the Zingiberales order to investigate structural and functional differences. RESULTS: The assembled chloroplast genomes of the four Heliconia species exhibited a typical quadripartite structure and ranged in length from 161,680 bp to 161,913 bp. All genomes contained 86 protein-coding genes. Comparative analysis revealed that the chloroplast genome structures of the different Heliconia species were highly conserved, with minor variations. Notably, the chloroplast genome of Heliconia was slightly shorter than those of other Zingiberales species, primarily due to the reduced length of the inverted repeat region. In terms of nucleotide diversity, Heliconia species exhibited lower diversity in their chloroplast genomes compared to other families within the Zingiberales order. DISCUSSION: This study provides valuable insights into the conserved nature of the chloroplast genome in Heliconia. The reduced chloroplast genome size, particularly the shortened inverted repeat region, marks a distinct feature of Heliconia within the Zingiberales family. Our findings also underscore the low nucleotide diversity within the chloroplast genomes of Heliconia species, which could be indicative of their evolutionary history and limited genetic differentiation. These results contribute to a broader understanding of chloroplast genome evolution in the Zingiberales and offer important genetic resources for future research on Heliconia and related species.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Calamus tetradactylus, a species primarily distributed in Vietnam, Laos, and southern China, is highly valued for its utilization as a small-diameter rattan material. While its physical and mechanical properties have been extensively studied, the genomic characteristics of C. tetradactylus remain largely unexplored. RESULTS: To gain a better understanding of its chloroplast genomic features and evolutionary relationships, we conducted sequencing and assembly of the chloroplast genome of C. tetradactylus. The complete chloroplast genome exhibited the typical highly conserved quartile structure, with specific variable regions identified in the single-copy region (like psbF-psbE, pi = 0.10327, ndhF-rpl32, pi = 0.10195), as well as genes such as trnT-GGU (pi = 0.05764) and ycf1 (pi = 0.03345) and others. We propose that these regions and genes hold potential as markers for species identification. Furthermore, phylogenetic analysis revealed that C. tetradactylus formed a distinct clade within the phylogenetic tree, alongside other Calamus species, and C. tetradactylus was most closely related to C. walkeri, providing support for the monophyly of the genus. CONCLUSION: The analysis of the chloroplast genome conducted in this study provides valuable insights that can contribute to the improvement of rattan breeding programs and facilitate sustainable development in the future.

Abstract: Teleosts are the most prolific vertebrates, occupying the vast majority of aquatic environments, and their pectoral fins have undergone remarkable physiological transformations throughout their evolution. Studying early teleost fishes, such as those belonging to the Osteoglossiformes order, could offer crucial insights into the adaptive evolution of pectoral fins within this group. In this study, we have assembled a chromosomal-level genome for the Clown featherback (Chitala ornata), achieving the highest quality genome assembly for Osteoglossiformes to date, with a contig N50 of 32.78 Mb and a scaffold N50 of 40.73 Mb. By combining phylogenetic analysis, we determined that the Clown featherback diverged approximately 202 to 203 million years ago (Ma), aligning with continental separation events. Our analysis revealed the intriguing discovery that a unique deletion of regulatory elements is adjacent to the Gli3 gene, specifically in teleosts. This deletion might be tied to the specialized adaptation of their pectoral fins. Furthermore, our findings indicate that specific contractions and expansions of transposable elements (TEs) in teleosts, including the Clown featherback, could be connected to their adaptive evolution. In essence, this study not only provides a high-quality genomic resource for Osteoglossiformes but also sheds light on the evolutionary trajectory of early teleosts.

Abstract: Mitochondria play a crucial role in numerous biological processes; however, limited methods and research have focused on revealing mitochondrial heterogeneity at the single-cell level. In this study, we optimized the DNBelab C4 single-cell ATAC (assay for transposase-accessible chromatin) sequencing workflow for single-cell mitochondrial sequencing (C4_mtscATAC-seq). We validated the effectiveness of our C4_mtscATAC-seq protocol by sequencing the HEK-293T cell line with two biological replicates, successfully capturing both mitochondrial content (~68% of total sequencing data) and open chromatin status simultaneously. Subsequently, we applied C4_mtscATAC-seq to investigate two mouse tissues, spleen and bone marrow, obtained from two mice aged 2 months and two mice aged 23 months. Our findings revealed higher mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) content in young tissues compared to more variable mitochondrial content in aged tissues, consistent with higher activity scores of nuclear genes associated with mitochondrial replication and transcription in young tissues. We detected a total of 22, 15, and 21 mtDNA mutations in the young spleen, aged spleen, and bone marrow, respectively, with most variant allele frequencies (VAF) below 1%. Moreover, we observed a higher number of mtDNA mutations with higher VAF in aged tissues compared to young tissues. Importantly, we identified three mtDNA variations (m.9821A>T, m.15219T>C, and m.15984C>T) with the highest VAF in both aged spleen and aged bone marrow. By comparing cells with and without these mtDNA variations, we analyzed differential open chromatin status to identify potential genes associated with these mtDNA variations, including transcription factors such as KLF15 and NRF1. Our study presents an alternative single-cell mitochondrial sequencing method and provides crude insights into age-related single-cell mitochondrial variations.

Abstract: Tardigrades are captivating organisms known for their resilience in extreme environments, including ultra-high-dose radiation, but the underlying mechanisms of this resilience remain largely unknown. Using genome, transcriptome, and proteome analysis of Hypsibius henanensis sp. nov., we explored the molecular basis contributing to radiotolerance in this organism. A putatively horizontally transferred gene, DOPA dioxygenase 1 (DODA1), responds to radiation and confers radiotolerance by synthesizing betalains-a type of plant pigment with free radical-scavenging properties. A tardigrade-specific radiation-induced disordered protein, TRID1, facilitates DNA damage repair through a mechanism involving phase separation. Two mitochondrial respiratory chain complex assembly proteins, BCS1 and NDUFB8, accumulate to accelerate nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD(+)) regeneration for poly(adenosine diphosphate-ribosyl)ation (PARylation) and subsequent poly(adenosine diphosphate-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1)-mediated DNA damage repair. These three observations expand our understanding of mechanisms of tardigrade radiotolerance.

Short Title: Cicer super-pangenome provides insights into species evolution and agronomic trait loci for crop improvement in chickpea
ISSN: 1061-4036
Abstract: Chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.)—an important legume crop cultivated in arid and semiarid regions—has limited genetic diversity. Efforts are being undertaken to broaden its diversity by utilizing its wild relatives, which remain largely unexplored. Here, we present the Cicer super-pangenome based on the de novo genome assemblies of eight annual Cicer wild species. We identified 24,827 gene families, including 14,748 core, 2,958 softcore, 6,212 dispensable and 909 species-specific gene families. The dispensable genome was enriched for genes related to key agronomic traits. Structural variations between cultivated and wild genomes were used to construct a graph-based genome, revealing variations in genes affecting traits such as flowering time, vernalization and disease resistance. These variations
will facilitate the transfer of valuable traits from wild Cicer species into elite chickpea varieties through marker-assisted selection or gene-editing. This study offers valuable insights into the genetic diversity and potential
avenues for crop improvement in chickpea.

Short Title: Deciphering recent transposition patterns in plants through comparison of 811 genome assemblies
ISSN: 1467-7644
Abstract: Transposable elements (TEs) are significant drivers of genome evolution, yet their recent dynamics and impacts within and among species, as well as the roles of host genes and non-coding RNAs in the transposition process, remain elusive. With advancements in large-scale pan-genome sequencing and the development of open data sharing, large-scale comparative genomics studies have become feasible. Here, we performed complete de novo TE annotations and identified active TEs in 310 plant genome assemblies across 119 species and seven crop populations. Using 811 high-quality genomes, we detected 13 844 553 TE-induced structural
variants (TE-SVs), providing unprecedented resolution in delineating recent TE activities. Our integrative analysis revealed a mutual evolutionary relationship between TEs and host genomes. On one hand, host genes and ncRNAs are involved in the transposition process, as evidenced by their colocalization and coactivation with TEs, and may play a role in chromatin regulation. On the other hand, TEs drive genetic innovation by promoting the duplication of host genes and inserting into regulatory regions. Moreover, genes influenced by active TEs are linked to plant growth, nutrient absorption, storage metabolism and environmental adaptation, aiding in crop domestication and adaptation. This TE dynamics atlas not only reveals evolutionary and functional features linked to transposition activity but also highlights the role of TEs in crop domestication and adaptation, paving the way for future exploration of TE-mediated genome evolution and crop improvement strategies.

Abstract: The past two decades has witnessed a remarkable increase in the number of microbial genomes retrieved from marine systems(1,2). However, it has remained challenging to translate this marine genomic diversity into biotechnological and biomedical applications(3,4). Here we recovered 43,191 bacterial and archaeal genomes from publicly available marine metagenomes, encompassing a wide range of diversity with 138 distinct phyla, redefining the upper limit of marine bacterial genome size and revealing complex trade-offs between the occurrence of CRISPR-Cas systems and antibiotic resistance genes. In silico bioprospecting of these marine genomes led to the discovery of a novel CRISPR-Cas9 system, ten antimicrobial peptides, and three enzymes that degrade polyethylene terephthalate. In vitro experiments confirmed their effectiveness and efficacy. This work provides evidence that global-scale sequencing initiatives advance our understanding of how microbial diversity has evolved in the oceans and is maintained, and demonstrates how such initiatives can be sustainably exploited to advance biotechnology and biomedicine.

Abstract: Chaetodontidae, known as butterflyfishes, are typical fish in coral ecosystems, exhibiting remarkable interspecific differences including body colour patterns and feeding ecology. In this study, we report genomes of three butterflyfish species (Chelmon rostratus, Chaetodon trifasciatus and Chaetodon auriga) and a closely related species from the Pomacanthidae family, Centropyge bicolour, with an average genome size of 65,611 Mb. Chelmon rostratus, comprising 24 chromosomes assembled to the chromosome level, could be served as a reference genome for butterflyfish. By conducting a collinearity analysis between butterflyfishes and several fishes, we elucidated the specific and conserved genomic features of butterflyfish, with particular emphasis on novel genes arising from tandem duplications and their potential functions. In addition to the two melanocyte-specific tyr genes commonly found in fish, we found the gene tyrp3, a new tyrosinase-related proteins gene in the reef fish, including butterflyfish and clownfish, implicating their involvement in the pigmentation diversity of fish. Additionally, we observed a tandem duplication expansion of three copies of nell1 gene in C. rostratus genome, which likely contribute to its unique jaw development and distinctive morphology of its sharp mouth. These results provided valuable genomic resources for further investigations into the genetic diversity and evolutionary adaptations of reef fish.

Abstract: The six species of lungfish possess both lungs and gills and are the closest extant relatives of tetrapods. Here, we report a single-cell transcriptome atlas of the West African lungfish (Protopterus annectens). This species manifests the most extreme form of terrestrialization, a life history strategy to survive dry periods that can last for years, characterized by dormancy and reversible adaptive changes of the gills and lungs. Our atlas highlights the cell type diversity of the West African lungfish, including gene expression consistent with phenotype changes of terrestrialization. Comparison with terrestrial tetrapods and ray-finned fishes reveals broad homology between the swim bladder and lung cell types as well as shared and idiosyncratic changes of the external gills of the West African lungfish and the internal gills of Atlantic salmon. The single-cell atlas presented here provides a valuable resource for further exploration of the respiratory system evolution in vertebrates and the diversity of lungfish terrestrialization.

Abstract: Characiformes is a diverse and evolutionarily significant order of freshwater fish encompassing over 2,300 species. Despite its diversity, our understanding of Characiformes' evolutionary relationships and adaptive mechanisms is limited due to insufficient genome sequences. In this study, we sequenced and assembled the genomes of four Characiformes species, three of which were chromosome-level assemblies. Our analyses revealed dynamic changes in gene family evolution, repeat sequences and variations in chromosomal collinearity within these genomes. With the assembled genomes, we were not only able to elucidate the evolutionary relationship of the four main orders in Otophysi but also indicated Characiformes as the paraphyletic group. Comparative genomic analysis with other available fish genomes shed light on the evolution of genes related to tooth development in Characiformes. Notably, variations in the copy number of secretory calcium-binding phosphoproteins (SCPP) genes were observed among different orders of Otophysi, indicating their potential contribution to the diversity of tooth types. Our study offers invaluable genome sequences and novel insights into Characiformes' evolution, paving the way for further genomic and evolutionary research in fish.

Abstract: Metagenomic sequencing facilitates large-scale constitutional analysis and functional characterization of complex microbial communities without cultivation. Recent advances in long-read sequencing techniques utilize long-range information to simplify repeat-aware metagenomic assembly puzzles and complex genome binning tasks. However, it remains methodologically challenging to remove host-derived DNA sequences from the microbial community at the read resolution due to high sequencing error rates and the absence of reference genomes. We here present Symbiont-Screener (https://github.com/BGI-Qingdao/Symbiont-Screener), a reference-free approach to identifying high-confidence host's long reads from symbionts and contaminants and overcoming the low sequencing accuracy according to a trio-based screening model. The remaining host's sequences are then automatically grouped by unsupervised clustering. When applied to both simulated and real long-read datasets, it maintains higher precision and recall rates of identifying the host's raw reads compared to other tools and hence promises the high-quality reconstruction of the host genome and associated metagenomes. Furthermore, we leveraged both PacBio HiFi and nanopore long reads to separate the host's sequences on a real host-microbe system, an algal-bacterial sample, and retrieved an obvious improvement of host assembly in terms of assembly contiguity, completeness, and purity. More importantly, the residual symbiotic microbiomes illustrate improved genomic profiling and assemblies after the screening, which elucidates a solid basis of data for downstream bioinformatic analyses, thus providing a novel perspective on symbiotic research.

Drought Resistance
Abstract: Terminal drought is one of the major constraints to crop production in chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.). In order to map drought tolerance related traits at high resolution, we sequenced multi-parent advanced generation intercross (MAGIC) population using whole genome resequencing approach and phenotyped it under drought stress environments for two consecutive years (2013-14 and 2014-15). A total of 52.02 billion clean reads containing 4.67 TB clean data were generated on the 1136 MAGIC lines and eight parental lines. Alignment of clean data on to the reference genome enabled identification of a total, 932,172 of SNPs, 35,973 insertions, and 35,726 deletions among the parental lines. A high-density genetic map was constructed using 57,180 SNPs spanning a map distance of 1606.69 cM. Using compressed mixed linear model, genome-wide association study (GWAS) enabled us to identify 737 markers significantly associated with days to 50% flowering, days to maturity, plant height, 100 seed weight, biomass, and harvest index. In addition to the GWAS approach, an identity-by-descent (IBD)-based mixed model approach was used to map quantitative trait loci (QTLs). The IBD-based mixed model approach detected major QTLs that were comparable to those from the GWAS analysis as well as some exclusive QTLs with smaller effects. The candidate genes like FRIGIDA and CaTIFY4b can be used for enhancing drought tolerance in chickpea. The genomic resources, genetic map, marker-trait associations, and QTLs identified in the study are valuable resources for the chickpea community for developing climate resilient chickpeas.

Abstract: Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) is Earth's most abundant wild animal, and its enormous biomass is vital to the Southern Ocean ecosystem. Here, we report a 48.01-Gb chromosome-level Antarctic krill genome, whose large genome size appears to have resulted from inter-genic transposable element expansions. Our assembly reveals the molecular architecture of the Antarctic krill circadian clock and uncovers expanded gene families associated with molting and energy metabolism, providing insights into adaptations to the cold and highly seasonal Antarctic environment. Population-level genome re-sequencing from four geographical sites around the Antarctic continent reveals no clear population structure but highlights natural selection associated with environmental variables. An apparent drastic reduction in krill population size 10 mya and a subsequent rebound 100 thousand years ago coincides with climate change events. Our findings uncover the genomic basis of Antarctic krill adaptations to the Southern Ocean and provide valuable resources for future Antarctic research.

Abstract: Mahogany species (family Meliaceae) are highly valued for their aesthetic and durable wood. Despite their economic and ecological importance, genomic resources for mahogany species are limited, hindering genetic improvement and conservation efforts. Here we perform chromosome-scale genome assemblies of two commercially important mahogany species: Swietenia macrophylla and Khaya senegalensis. By combining 10X sequencing and Hi-C data, we assemble high-quality genomes of 274.49 Mb (S. macrophylla) and 406.50 Mb (K. senegalensis), with scaffold N50 lengths of 8.51 Mb and 7.85 Mb, respectively. A total of 99.38% and 98.05% of the assembled sequences are anchored to 28 pseudo-chromosomes in S. macrophylla and K. senegalensis, respectively. We predict 34,129 and 31,908 protein-coding genes in S. macrophylla and K. senegalensis, respectively, of which 97.44% and 98.49% are functionally annotated. The chromosome-scale genome assemblies of these mahogany species could serve as a vital genetic resource, especially in understanding the properties of non-model woody plants. These high-quality genomes could support the development of molecular markers for breeding programs, conservation efforts, and the sustainable management of these valuable forest resources.

Abstract: Wood is the most important natural and endlessly renewable source of energy. Despite the ecological and economic importance of wood, many aspects of its formation have not yet been investigated. We performed chromosome-scale genome assemblies of three timber trees (Ochroma pyramidale, Mesua ferrea, and Tectona grandis) which exhibit different wood properties such as wood density, hardness, growth rate, and fiber cell wall thickness. The combination of 10X, stLFR, Hi-Fi sequencing and HiC data led us to assemble high-quality genomes evident by scaffold N50 length of 55.97 Mb (O. pyramidale), 22.37 Mb (M. ferrea) and 14.55 Mb (T. grandis) with >97% BUSCO completeness of the assemblies. A total of 35774, 24027, and 44813 protein-coding genes were identified in M. ferrea, T. grandis and O. pyramidale, respectively. The data generated in this study is anticipated to serve as a valuable genetic resource and will promote comparative genomic analyses, and it is of practical importance in gaining a further understanding of the wood properties in non-model woody species.

Abstract: The bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis mouse model is commonly used in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis research, but its cellular and molecular changes and efficiency as a model at the molecular level are not fully understood. In this study, we used spatial transcriptome technology to investigate the cellular and molecular changes in the lungs of bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis mouse models. Our analyses revealed cell dynamics during fibrosis in epithelial cells, mesenchymal cells, immunocytes, and erythrocytes with their spatial distribution available. We confirmed the differentiation of the alveolar type II (AT2) cell type expressing Krt8, and we inferred their trajectories from both the AT2 cells and club cells. In addition to the fibrosis process, we also noticed evidence of self-resolving, especially to identify possible self-resolving related genes, including Prkca. Our findings provide insights into the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying fibrosis resolution and represent the first spatiotemporal transcriptome dataset of the bleomycin-induced fibrosis mouse model.

Abstract: Understanding the factors that cause endangered populations to either grow or decline is crucial for preserving biodiversity. Conservation efforts often address extrinsic threats, such as environmental degradation and overexploitation, that can limit the recovery of endangered populations. Genetic factors such as inbreeding depression can also affect population dynamics but these effects are rarely measured in the wild and thus often neglected in conservation efforts. Here we show that inbreeding depression strongly influences the population dynamics of an endangered killer whale population, despite genomic signatures of purging of deleterious alleles via natural selection. We find that the 'Southern Residents', which are currently endangered despite nearly 50 years of conservation efforts, exhibit strong inbreeding depression for survival. Our population models suggest that this inbreeding depression limits population growth and predict further decline if the population remains genetically isolated and typical environmental conditions continue. The Southern Residents also had more inferred homozygous deleterious alleles than three other, growing, populations, further suggesting that inbreeding depression affects population fitness. These results demonstrate that inbreeding depression can substantially limit the recovery of endangered populations. Conservation actions focused only on extrinsic threats may therefore fail to account for key intrinsic genetic factors that also limit population growth.

Short Title: Whole-genome resequencing deciphers new insight into genetic diversity and signatures of resistance in cultivated cotton Gossypium hirsutum
ISSN: 1073-6085
Abstract: Cotton is an important crop that produces fiber and cottonseed oil for the textile and oil industry. However, cotton leaf curl virus disease (CLCuD) stress is limiting its yield in several Asian countries. In this study, we have sequenced Mac7 accession, a Gossypium hirsutum resistance source against several biotic stresses. By aligning with the Gossypium hirsutum (AD1) 'TM-1' genome, a total of 4.7 and 1.2 million SNPs and InDels were identified in the Mac7 genome. The gene ontology and metabolic pathway enrichment indicated SNPs and InDels role in nucleotide bindings, secondary metabolite synthesis, and plant-pathogen interaction pathways. Furthermore, the RNA-seq data in different tissues and qPCR expression profiling under CLCuD provided individual gene roles in resistant and susceptible accessions. Interestingly, the differential NLR genes demonstrated higher expression in resistant plants rather than in susceptible plants expression. The current resequencing results may provide primary data to identify DNA resistance markers which will be helpful in marker-assisted breeding for development of Mac7-derived resistance lines.

Abstract: Biofilm formation is a vital factor for the survival and adaptation of bacteria in diverse environmental niches. Experimental evolution combined with the advancement of whole-population genome sequencing provides us a powerful tool to understand the genomic dynamic of evolutionary adaptation to different environments, such as during biofilm development. Previous studies described the genetic and phenotypic changes of selected clones from experimentally evolved Bacillus thuringiensis and Bacillus subtilis that were adapted under abiotic and biotic biofilm conditions. However, the full understanding of the dynamic evolutionary landscapes was lacking. Furthermore, the differences and similarities of adaptive mechanisms in B. thuringiensis and B. subtilis were not identified. To overcome these limitations, we performed longitudinal whole-population genome sequencing to study the underlying genetic dynamics at high resolution. Our study provides the first comprehensive mutational landscape of two bacterial species' biofilms that is adapted to an abiotic and biotic surface.

Abstract: Data visualization empowers researchers to communicate their results that support scientific reasoning in an intuitive way. Three-dimension (3D) spatially resolved transcriptomic atlases constructed from multi-view and high-dimensional data have rapidly emerged as a powerful tool to unravel spatial gene expression patterns and cell type distribution in biological samples, revolutionizing the understanding of gene regulatory interactions and cell niches. However, limited accessible tools for data visualization impede the potential impact and application of this technology. Here we introduce VT3D, a visualization toolbox that allows users to explore 3D transcriptomic data, enabling gene expression projection to any 2D plane of interest, 2D virtual slice creation and visualization, and interactive 3D data browsing with surface model plots. In addition, it can either work on personal devices in standalone mode or be hosted as a web-based server. We apply VT3D to multiple datasets produced by the most popular techniques, including both sequencing-based approaches (Stereo-seq, spatial transcriptomics, and Slide-seq) and imaging-based approaches (MERFISH and STARMap), and successfully build a 3D atlas database that allows interactive data browsing. We demonstrate that VT3D bridges the gap between researchers and spatially resolved transcriptomics, thus accelerating related studies such as embryogenesis and organogenesis processes. The source code of VT3D is available at https://github.com/BGI-Qingdao/VT3D, and the modeled atlas database is available at http://www.bgiocean.com/vt3d_example.

Abstract: Parasitic plants have evolved to be subtly or severely dependent on host plants to complete their life cycle. To provide new insights into the biology of parasitic plants in general, we assembled genomes for members of the sandalwood order Santalales, including a stem hemiparasite (Scurrula) and two highly modified root holoparasites (Balanophora) that possess chimaeric host-parasite tubers. Comprehensive genome comparisons reveal that hemiparasitic Scurrula has experienced a relatively minor degree of gene loss compared with autotrophic plants, consistent with its moderate degree of parasitism. Nonetheless, patterns of gene loss appear to be substantially divergent across distantly related lineages of hemiparasites. In contrast, Balanophora has experienced substantial gene loss for the same sets of genes as an independently evolved holoparasite lineage, the endoparasitic Sapria (Malpighiales), and the two holoparasite lineages experienced convergent contraction of large gene families through loss of paralogues. This unprecedented convergence supports the idea that despite their extreme and strikingly divergent life histories and morphology, the evolution of these and other holoparasitic lineages can be shaped by highly predictable modes of genome reduction. We observe substantial evidence of relaxed selection in retained genes for both hemi- and holoparasitic species. Transcriptome data also document unusual and novel interactions between Balanophora and host plants at the host-parasite tuber interface tissues, with evidence of mRNA exchange, substantial and active hormone exchange and immune responses in parasite and host.

Abstract: Elucidating the cellular organization of the cerebral cortex is critical for understanding brain structure and function. Using large-scale single-nucleus RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomic analysis of 143 macaque cortical regions, we obtained a comprehensive atlas of 264 transcriptome-defined cortical cell types and mapped their spatial distribution across the entire cortex. We characterized the cortical layer and region preferences of glutamatergic, GABAergic, and non-neuronal cell types, as well as regional differences in cell-type composition and neighborhood complexity. Notably, we discovered a relationship between the regional distribution of various cell types and the region's hierarchical level in the visual and somatosensory systems. Cross-species comparison of transcriptomic data from human, macaque, and mouse cortices further revealed primate-specific cell types that are enriched in layer 4, with their marker genes expressed in a region-dependent manner. Our data provide a cellular and molecular basis for understanding the evolution, development, aging, and pathogenesis of the primate brain.

Title: Microbiota–muscle/immune interactions in rhesus macaque under simulated microgravity revealed by integrated multi‐omics analysis
Journal: JCSM Rapid Communications
Volume: 5

Short Title: Microbiota–muscle/immune interactions in rhesus macaque under simulated microgravity revealed by integrated multi‐omics analysis
ISSN: 2617-1619
Abstract: Background
Long-term exposure to microgravity during spaceflight has adverse effects on human health including muscle atrophy, impaired immune function, and alterations in gut microbiome profile. Gut microorganisms influence a wide range of host biological processes, but their interactions with skeletal muscle and the immune system under microgravity have yet to be elucidated.

Methods
Rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) were subjected to −6° head-down tilted bed rest (HDBR) for 6 weeks. Faecal samples, skeletal muscle tissue, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were collected for metagenomic, metabolomic, and transcriptomic analyses, respectively, and further integrated for a multi-omics analysis.

Results
Head-down tilted bed rest significantly altered taxon abundance (P < 0.05) in 1 class, 5 orders, 11 families, 55 genera, and 122 species of microbes. We also identified the significantly changed metabolites (P < 0.05, fold change >1.2, variable importance in projection >1) in atrophied muscles, including some crucial metabolites (such as l-alanine and l-carnitine) and hub metabolites (such as pyridoxamine and epinephrine) involved in energy metabolism. Transcriptomic analysis of PBMCs revealed genes related to leucocyte activation, differentiation, and interleukin-2 production that were differentially expressed as a result of HDBR exposure (fold change >2 and P < 0.05). By integrating multi-omics analysis, we identified three bacterial genera (Klebsiella, Kluyvera, and Bifidobacterium) that were closely associated with immune dysfunction and five (including Oligella, Sporosarcina, Citrobacter, Weissella, and Myroides) that were associated with abnormal metabolism of amino acids in atrophied muscles induced by HDBR. The reduced abundance of butyrate-producing colon bacteria Eubacterium, Roseburia, and their cross-feeding bacteria Bifidobacteria may contribute to the impaired immune function and muscle atrophy caused by HDBR.

Conclusions
This is the first report of the HDBR-associated changes in gut microbiota composition, metabolomics of skeletal muscle, and transcripts of PBMCs in a non-human primate. The underlying microbiota–muscle and microbiota–immune interactions during simulated microgravity imply that modulation of gut microbiota may represent a novel strategy for enhancing the health and safety of crew members during long-term space expeditions.

Abstract: The plastid organelle is essential for many vital cellular processes and the growth and development of plants. The availability of a large number of complete plastid genomes could be effectively utilized to understand the evolution of the plastid genomes and phylogenetic relationships among plants. We comprehensively analyzed the plastid genomes of Viridiplantae comprising 3,654 taxa from 298 families and 111 orders and compared the genomic organizations in their plastid genomic DNA among major clades, which include gene gain/loss, gene copy number, GC content, and gene blocks. We discovered that some important genes that exhibit similar functions likely formed gene blocks, such as the psb family presumably showing co-occurrence and forming gene blocks in Viridiplantae. The inverted repeats (IRs) in plastid genomes have doubled in size across land plants, and their GC content is substantially higher than non-IR genes. By employing three different data sets [all nucleotide positions (nt123), only the first and second codon positions (nt12), and amino acids (AA)], our phylogenomic analyses revealed Chlorokybales + Mesostigmatales as the earliest-branching lineage of streptophytes. Hornworts, mosses, and liverworts forming a monophylum were identified as the sister lineage of tracheophytes. Based on nt12 and AA data sets, monocots, Chloranthales and magnoliids are successive sister lineages to the eudicots + Ceratophyllales clade. The comprehensive taxon sampling and analysis of different data sets from plastid genomes recovered well-supported relationships of green plants, thereby contributing to resolving some long-standing uncertainties in the plant phylogeny.

Abstract: Sea buckthorn (Hippophae rhamnoides), a horticulturally multipurpose species in the family Elaeagnaceae, can build associations with Frankia actinomycetes to enable symbiotic nitrogen-fixing. Currently, no high-quality reference genome is available for an actinorhizal plant, which greatly hinders the study of actinorhizal symbiotic nodulation. Here, by combining short-read, long-read and Hi-C sequencing technologies, we generated a chromosome-level reference genome of H. rhamnoides (scaffold N50: 65 Mb, and genome size: 730 Mb) and predicted 30 812 protein-coding genes mainly on 12 pseudochromosomes. Hippophae rhamnoides was found to share a high proportion of symbiotic nodulation genes with Medicago truncatula, implying a shared molecular mechanism between actinorhizal and rhizobial symbioses. Phylogenetic analysis clustered the three paralogous NODULE INCEPTION (NIN) genes of H. rhamnoides with those of other nodulating species, forming the NIN group that most likely evolved from the ancestral NLP group. The genome of H. rhamnoides will help us to decipher the underlying genetic programming of actinorhizal symbiosis, and our high-quality genome and transcriptomic resources will make H. rhamnoides a new excellent model plant for actinorhizal symbiosis research.

Abstract: In order to explore the microbial diversity in industrial effluents, and on this basis, to verify the feasibility of tracking industrial effluents in sewer networks based on sequencing data, we collected 28 sewage samples from the industrial effluents relative to four factories in Shenzhen, China, and sequenced the 16S rRNA genes to profile the microbial compositions. We identified 5413 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) in total, and found that microbial compositions were highly diverse among samples from different locations in the sewer system, with only 107 OTUs shared by 90% of the samples. These shared OTUs were enriched in the phylum of Proteobacteria, the families of Comamonadaceae and Pseudomonadaceae, as well as the genus of Pseudomonas, with both degradation related and pathogenic bacteria. More importantly, we found differences in microbial composition among samples relevant to different factories, and identified microbial markers differentiating effluents from these factories, which can be used to track the sources of the effluents. This study improved our understanding of microbial diversity in industrial effluents, proved the feasibility of industrial effluent source tracking based on sequencing data, and provided an alternative technique solution for environmental surveillance and management.

Abstract: Genetic and environmental factors collectively determine plant growth and yield. In the past 20 years, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been conducted on crops to decipher genetic loci that contribute to growth and yield, however, plant genotype appears to be insufficient to explain the trait variations. Here, we unravel the associations between genotypic, phenotypic, and rhizoplane microbiota variables of 827 foxtail millet cultivars by an integrated GWAS, microbiome-wide association studies (MWAS) and microbiome genome-wide association studies (mGWAS) method. We identify 257 rhizoplane microbial biomarkers associated with six key agronomic traits and validated the microbial-mediated growth effects on foxtail millet using marker strains isolated from the field. The rhizoplane microbiota composition is mainly driven by variations in plant genes related to immunity, metabolites, hormone signaling and nutrient uptake. Among these, the host immune gene FLS2 and transcription factor bHLH35 are widely associated with the microbial taxa of the rhizoplane. We further uncover a plant genotype-microbiota interaction network that contributes to phenotype plasticity. The microbial-mediated growth effects on foxtail millet are dependent on the host genotype, suggesting that precision microbiome management could be used to engineer high-yielding cultivars in agriculture systems.

Abstract: Zero hunger and good health could be realized by 2030 through effective conservation, characterization and utilization of germplasm resources1. So far, few chickpea (Cicer arietinum) germplasm accessions have been characterized at the genome sequence level2. Here we present a detailed map of variation in 3,171 cultivated and 195 wild accessions to provide publicly available resources for chickpea genomics research and breeding. We constructed a chickpea pan-genome to describe genomic diversity across cultivated chickpea and its wild progenitor accessions. A divergence tree using genes present in around 80% of individuals in one species allowed us to estimate the divergence of Cicer over the last 21 million years. Our analysis found chromosomal segments and genes that show signatures of selection during domestication, migration and improvement. The chromosomal locations of deleterious mutations responsible for limited genetic diversity and decreased fitness were identified in elite germplasm. We identified superior haplotypes for improvement-related traits in landraces that can be introgressed into elite breeding lines through haplotype-based breeding, and found targets for purging deleterious alleles through genomics-assisted breeding and/or gene editing. Finally, we propose three crop breeding strategies based on genomic prediction to enhance crop productivity for 16 traits while avoiding the erosion of genetic diversity through optimal contribution selection (OCS)-based pre-breeding. The predicted performance for 100-seed weight, an important yield-related trait, increased by up to 23% and 12% with OCS- and haplotype-based genomic approaches, respectively.

Abstract: The 15 species of small carnivorous marsupials that comprise the genus Antechinus exhibit semelparity, a rare life-history strategy in mammals where synchronized death occurs after one breeding season. Antechinus males, but not females, age rapidly (demonstrate organismal senescence) during the breeding season and show promise as new animal models of ageing. Some antechinus species are also threatened or endangered. Here, we report a chromosome-level genome of a male yellow-footed antechinus Antechinus flavipes. The genome assembly has a total length of 3.2 Gb with a contig N50 of 51.8 Mb and a scaffold N50 of 636.7 Mb. We anchored and oriented 99.7% of the assembly on seven pseudochromosomes and found that repetitive DNA sequences occupy 51.8% of the genome. Draft genome assemblies of three related species in the subfamily Phascogalinae, two additional antechinus species (Antechinus argentus and A. arktos) and the iteroparous sister species Murexia melanurus, were also generated. Preliminary demographic analysis supports the hypothesis that climate change during the Pleistocene isolated species in Phascogalinae and shaped their population size. A transcriptomic profile across the A. flavipes breeding season allowed us to identify genes associated with aspects of the male die-off. The chromosome-level A. flavipes genome provides a steppingstone to understanding an enigmatic life-history strategy and a resource to assist the conservation of antechinuses.

Abstract: Metagenomic evidence of great genetic diversity within the nonconserved regions of the human gut microbial genomes appeals for new methods to elucidate the species-level variability at high resolution. However, current approaches cannot satisfy this methodologically challenge. In this study, we proposed an efficient binning-first-and-assembly-later strategy, named MetaTrass, to recover high-quality species-resolved genomes based on public reference genomes and the single-tube long fragment read (stLFR) technology, which enables cobarcoding. MetaTrass can generate genomes with longer contiguity, higher completeness, and lower contamination than those produced by conventional assembly-first-and-binning-later strategies. From a simulation study on a mock microbial community, MetaTrass showed the potential to improve the contiguity of assembly from kb to Mb without accuracy loss, as compared to other methods based on the next-generation sequencing technology. From four human fecal samples, MetaTrass successfully retrieved 178 high-quality genomes, whereas only 58 ones were provided by the optimal performance of other conventional strategies. Most importantly, these high-quality genomes confirmed the high level of genetic diversity among different samples and unveiled much more. MetaTrass was designed to work with metagenomic reads sequenced by stLFR technology, but is also applicable to other types of cobarcoding libraries. With the high capability of assembling high-quality genomes of metagenomic data sets, MetaTrass seeks to facilitate the study of spatial characters and dynamics of complex microbial communities at enhanced resolution. The open-source code of MetaTrass is available at https://github.com/BGI-Qingdao/MetaTrass.

Abstract: Cycads represent one of the most ancient lineages of living seed plants. Identifying genomic features uniquely shared by cycads and other extant seed plants, but not non-seed-producing plants, may shed light on the origin of key innovations, as well as the early diversification of seed plants. Here, we report the 10.5-Gb reference genome of Cycas panzhihuaensis, complemented by the transcriptomes of 339 cycad species. Nuclear and plastid phylogenomic analyses strongly suggest that cycads and Ginkgo form a clade sister to all other living gymnosperms, in contrast to mitochondrial data, which place cycads alone in this position. We found evidence for an ancient whole-genome duplication in the common ancestor of extant gymnosperms. The Cycas genome contains four homologues of the fitD gene family that were likely acquired via horizontal gene transfer from fungi, and these genes confer herbivore resistance in cycads. The male-specific region of the Y chromosome of C. panzhihuaensis contains a MADS-box transcription factor expressed exclusively in male cones that is similar to a system reported in Ginkgo, suggesting that a sex determination mechanism controlled by MADS-box genes may have originated in the common ancestor of cycads and Ginkgo. The C. panzhihuaensis genome provides an important new resource of broad utility for biologists.

Abstract: Introduction: Cultivated peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.) is an important oil crop for human nutrition and is cultivated in >100 countries. However, the present knowledge of its genomic diversity, evolution, and loci related to the seed traits is limited. Objectives: Our study intended to (1) uncover the population structure and the demographic history of peanuts, (2) identify signatures of selection that occurred during peanut improvement breeding, and (3) detect and verify the functions of candidate genes associated with seed traits. Methods: We explored the population relationship and the evolution of peanuts using a largescale single nucleotide polymorphism dataset generated from the genome-wide resequencing of 203 cultivated peanuts. Genetic diversity and genomic scan analyses were applied to identify selective loci for genomicselection breeding. Genome-wide association studies, transgenic experiments, and RNA-seq were employed to identify the candidate genes associated with seed traits. Results: Our study revealed that the 203 resequenced accessions were divided into four genetic groups, consistent with their botanical classification. Moreover, the var. peruviana and var. fastigiata subpopulations have diverged to a greater extent than the others, and var. peruviana may be the earliest variant in the evolution from tetraploid ancestors. A recent dramatic expansion in the effective population size of the cultivated peanuts ca. 300-500 years ago was also noted. Selective sweeps underlying quantitative trait loci and genes of seed size, plant architecture, and disease resistance coincide with the major goals of improved peanut breeding compared with the landrace and cultivar populations. Genome-wide association testing with functional analysis led to the identification of two genes involved in seed weight and seed length regulation. Conclusion: Our study provides valuable information for understanding the genomic diversity and the evolution of peanuts and serves as a genomic basis for improving peanut cultivars.

Abstract: Clarifying the evolutionary processes underlying species diversification and adaptation is a key focus of evolutionary biology. Begonia (Begoniaceae) is one of the most species-rich angiosperm genera with c. 2000 species, most of which are shade-adapted. Here, we present chromosome-scale genome assemblies for four species of Begonia (B. loranthoides, B. masoniana, B. darthvaderiana and B. peltatifolia), and whole genome shotgun data for an additional 74 Begonia representatives to investigate lineage evolution and shade adaptation of the genus. The four genome assemblies range in size from 331.75 Mb (B. peltatifolia) to 799.83 Mb (B. masoniana), and harbor 22 059-23 444 protein-coding genes. Synteny analysis revealed a lineage-specific whole-genome duplication (WGD) that occurred just before the diversification of Begonia. Functional enrichment of gene families retained after WGD highlights the significance of modified carbohydrate metabolism and photosynthesis possibly linked to shade adaptation in the genus, which is further supported by expansions of gene families involved in light perception and harvesting. Phylogenomic reconstructions and genomics studies indicate that genomic introgression has also played a role in the evolution of Begonia. Overall, this study provides valuable genomic resources for Begonia and suggests potential drivers underlying the diversity and adaptive evolution of this mega-diverse clade.

Short Title: The earth BioGenome project 2020: Starting the clock
ISBN/ISSN: 0027-8424
Abstract: November 2020 marked 2 y since the launch of the Earth BioGenome Project (EBP), which aims to sequence all known eukaryotic species in a 10-y timeframe. Since then, significant progress has been made across all aspects of the EBP roadmap, as outlined in the 2018 article describing the project’s goals, strategies, and challenges (1). The launch phase has ended and the clock has started on reaching the EBP’s major milestones. This Special Feature explores the many facets of the EBP, including a review of progress, a description of major scientific goals, exemplar projects, ethical legal and social issues, and applications of biodiversity genomics. In this Introduction, we summarize the current status of the EBP, held virtually October 5 to 9, 2020, including recent updates through February 2021. References to the nine Perspective articles included in this Special Feature are cited to guide the reader toward deeper understanding of the goals and challenges facing the EBP.

Abstract: A global international initiative, such as the Earth BioGenome Project (EBP), requires both agreement and coordination on standards to ensure that the collective effort generates rapid progress toward its goals. To this end, the EBP initiated five technical standards committees comprising volunteer members from the global genomics scientific community: Sample Collection and Processing, Sequencing and Assembly, Annotation, Analysis, and IT and Informatics. The current versions of the resulting standards documents are available on the EBP website, with the recognition that opportunities, technologies, and challenges may improve or change in the future, requiring flexibility for the EBP to meet its goals. Here, we describe some highlights from the proposed standards, and areas where additional challenges will need to be met.

Abstract: Green plants play a fundamental role in ecosystems, human health, and agriculture. As de novo genomes are being generated for all known eukaryotic species as advocated by the Earth BioGenome Project, increasing genomic information on green land plants is essential. However, setting standards for the generation and storage of the complex set of genomes that characterize the green lineage of life is a major challenge for plant scientists. Such standards will need to accommodate the immense variation in green plant genome size, transposable element content, and structural complexity while enabling research into the molecular and evolutionary processes that have resulted in this enormous genomic variation. Here we provide an overview and assessment of the current state of knowledge of green plant genomes. To date fewer than 300 complete chromosome-scale genome assemblies representing fewer than 900 species have been generated across the estimated 450,000 to 500,000 species in the green plant clade. These genomes range in size from 12 Mb to 27.6 Gb and are biased toward agricultural crops with large branches of the green tree of life untouched by genomic-scale sequencing. Locating suitable tissue samples of most species of plants, especially those taxa from extreme environments, remains one of the biggest hurdles to increasing our genomic inventory. Furthermore, the annotation of plant genomes is at present undergoing intensive improvement. It is our hope that this fresh overview will help in the development of genomic quality standards for a cohesive and meaningful synthesis of green plant genomes as we scale up for the future.

Abstract: Lychee is an exotic tropical fruit with a distinct flavor. The genome of cultivar 'Feizixiao' was assembled into 15 pseudochromosomes, totaling ~470 Mb. High heterozygosity (2.27%) resulted in two complete haplotypic assemblies. A total of 13,517 allelic genes (42.4%) were differentially expressed in diverse tissues. Analyses of 72 resequenced lychee accessions revealed two independent domestication events. The extremely early maturing cultivars preferentially aligned to one haplotype were domesticated from a wild population in Yunnan, whereas the late-maturing cultivars that mapped mostly to the second haplotype were domesticated independently from a wild population in Hainan. Early maturing cultivars were probably developed in Guangdong via hybridization between extremely early maturing cultivar and late-maturing cultivar individuals. Variable deletions of a 3.7 kb region encompassed by a pair of CONSTANS-like genes probably regulate fruit maturation differences among lychee cultivars. These genomic resources provide insights into the natural history of lychee domestication and will accelerate the improvement of lychee and related crops.

Abstract: Genomic studies are now poised to explore whole communities of species. The ~70 species of woody plants that anchor the coastal ecosystems of the tropics, collectively referred to as mangroves, are particularly suited to this exploration. In this study, we de novo sequenced the whole genomes of 32 mangroves, which we combined with other sequences of 30 additional species, comprising almost all mangroves globally. These community-wide genomic data will be valuable for ecology, evolution and biodiversity research. While the data revealed 27 independent origins of mangroves, the total phylogeny shows only modest increases in species number, even in coastal areas of active speciation, suggesting that mangrove extinction is common. A possible explanation for common extinction is the frequent sea-level rises and falls (SLRs and SLFs) documented in the geological record. Indeed, near-extinctions of species with extremely small population size (N) often happened during periods of rapid SLR, as revealed by the genome-wide heterozygosity of almost all mangroves. Reduction in N has possibly been further compounded by population fragmentation and the subsequent accumulation of deleterious mutations, thus pushing mangroves even closer to extinction. Crucially, the impact of the next SLR will be exacerbated by human encroachment into these mangrove habitats, potentially altering the ecosystems of tropical coasts irreversibly.

Abstract: The fall armyworm (FAW), Spodoptera frugiperda, is a destructive pest native to America and has recently become an invasive insect pest in China. Because of its rapid spread and great risks in China, understanding of FAW genetic background and pesticide resistance is urgent and essential to develop effective management strategies. Here, we assembled a chromosome-level genome of a male FAW (SFynMstLFR) and compared re-sequencing results of the populations from America, Africa, and China. Strain identification of 163 individuals collected from America, Africa and China showed that both C and R strains were found in the American populations, while only C strain was found in the Chinese and African populations. Moreover, population genomics analysis showed that populations from Africa and China have close relationship with significantly genetic differentiation from American populations. Taken together, FAWs invaded into China were most likely originated from Africa. Comparative genomics analysis displayed that the cytochrome p450 gene family is extremely expanded to 425 members in FAW, of which 283 genes are specific to FAW. Treatments of Chinese populations with twenty-three pesticides showed the variant patterns of transcriptome profiles, and several detoxification genes such as AOX, UGT and GST specially responded to the pesticides. These findings will be useful in developing effective strategies for management of FAW in China and other invaded areas.

Abstract: Introduction: Legume crops are an important source of protein and oil for human health and in fixing atmospheric N2 for soil enrichment. With an objective to accelerate much-needed genetic analyses and breeding applications, draft genome assemblies were generated in several legume crops; many of them are not high quality because they are mainly based on short reads. However, the superior quality of gen-ome assembly is crucial for a detailed understanding of genomic architecture, genome evolution, and crop improvement. Objectives: Present study was undertaken with an objective of developing improved chromosome-length genome assemblies in six different legumes followed by their systematic investigation to unravel differ-ent aspects of genome organization and legume evolution.Methods: We employed in situ Hi-C data to improve the existing draft genomes and performed different evolutionary and comparative analyses using improved genome assemblies.Results: We have developed chromosome-length genome assemblies in chickpea, pigeonpea, soybean, subterranean clover, and two wild progenitor species of cultivated groundnut (A. duranensis and A. ipaen-sis). A comprehensive comparative analysis of these genome assemblies offered improved insights into various evolutionary events that shaped the present-day legume species. We highlighted the expansion of gene families contributing to unique traits such as nodulation in legumes, gravitropism in groundnut, and oil biosynthesis in oilseed legume crops such as groundnut and soybean. As examples, we have demonstrated the utility of improved genome assemblies for enhancing the resolution of "QTL-hotspot" identification for drought tolerance in chickpea and marker-trait associations for agronomic traits in pigeonpea through genome-wide association study. Genomic resources developed in this study are pub-licly available through an online repository, 'Legumepedia'.Conclusion: This study reports chromosome-length genome assemblies of six legume species and demon-strates the utility of these assemblies in crop improvement. The genomic resources developed here will have significant role in accelerating genetic improvement applications of legume crops.(c) 2022 The Authors.

Abstract: In this study, we performed de novo genome assembly to build a cynomolgus macaque reference genome (MaFaC) using long-read sequencing data and multiple
scaffolding strategies. In detail, high-quality DNA was extracted from the peripheral blood of a male cynomolgus macaque that was chosen by us (Fig. S1A). At first, 95 long-read SMRT cells were sequenced (about 65-fold genome coverage, subreads N50 11 Kb) and contigs were assembled by using FALCON (Chin et al., 2016). To further improve the accuracy of the assembly, Illumina short-read data from four monkeys (about 60-fold genome coverage), which included the monkey used for long-read sequencing, were used to correct remaining errors in the sequence contigs using Pilon (Walker et al., 2014) (Table S1). Then, the Hi-C data (48.72-fold genome coverage) was used to link contigs to their respective chromosomes (Fig. S1B). Finally, we constructed a de novo chromosome-scale cynomolgus macaque genome assembly (MaFaC) with a total length of 3.06 Gb, contig N50 of 6.03 Mb, and scaffold N50 of 152.38 Mb (Table S2). The new assembly includes fewer fragments and higher contiguity than MF 5.0 (7,254 vs. 88,075, 11-fold reduction in contig numbers), and in terms of length, both contig N50 and scaffold N50 were improved by 75-fold and 1.7-fold, respectively (Figs. 1A and S1C; Table S2). MF 5.0 was built from a female monkey sample with no Y chromosome, our assembly makes up for this deficiency.

Short Title: Chromosome‐level genome assembly of Lethenteron reissneri provides insights into lamprey evolution
ISSN: 1755-098X
Abstract: The reissner lamprey Lethenteron reissneri, belonging to the class Cyclostomata, serves as a bridge between invertebrates and jawed vertebrates, and is considered the sister group of jawed vertebrates. However, despite this evolutionary significance, the genetic mechanisms underlying the adaptive evolution of the lamprey lineage remain unclear. Here, we assembled a 1.06 Gb chromosome-level draft genome of L. reissneri, with 72 chromosomes (ranging in length from 4.5 Mb to 25.9 Mb) and a scaffold N50 length of 13.23 Mb. Genome quality comparisons revealed that the reissner lamprey genome has higher completeness and contiguity than the previously published sea lamprey and Japanese lamprey genomes. Moreover, reissner lamprey, sea lamprey, and Japanese lamprey species share similar transposable element profiles and Hox gene cluster compositions, suggesting that a burst of transposable element activity and whole genome duplication occurred before their divergence. Additionally, the Lip gene copy numbers, which have been studied for their functions in the host defence system, were found to be expanded uniquely in lamprey lineages, suggesting key roles for these genes in lamprey evolution and adaptation. We also identified two neural-related genes, Nrn1 and Unc13a, with copy number expansions in jawed vertebrates, which may be functionally relevant to the origin of lamprey brains. Hence, this study not only provides the first chromosome-level reference genome for Cyclostomata, but also highlights features of the unique biology and adaptive evolution of the lamprey lineage.

Abstract: Moso bamboo (Phyllostachys edulis) is an economically and ecologically important nontimber forestry species. Further development of this species as a sustainable bamboo resource has been hindered by a lack of population genome information. Here, we report a moso bamboo genomic variation atlas of 5.45 million single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from whole-genome resequencing of 427 individuals covering 15 representative geographic areas. We uncover low genetic diversity, high genotype heterozygosity, and genes under balancing selection underlying moso bamboo population adaptation. We infer its demographic history with one bottleneck and its recently small population without a rebound. We define five phylogenetic groups and infer that one group probably originated by a single-origin event from East China. Finally, we conduct genome-wide association analysis of nine important property-related traits to identify candidate genes, many of which are involved in cell wall, carbohydrate metabolism, and environmental adaptation. These results provide a foundation and resources for understanding moso bamboo evolution and the genetic mechanisms of agriculturally important traits.

Abstract: Smilax glabra is a perennial woody scandent shrub, of which the dried aerial tuber has been used as Chinese medicine. Here, we sequenced S. glabra and assembled its complete chloroplast (cp) genome. The genome is 157,889 bp in length and has a typical quadripartite structure. We annotated 131 genes, of which 84 were protein-coding genes, 37 were tRNAs and 8 were rRNA genes. Phylogenetic analysis of this genome with 26 representatives Liliales fully resolved S. glabra in a clade with S. china. The phylogenetic tree we constructed is largely consistent with recently published phylogenetic trees using both complete chloroplast genomes and marker gene sequences.

Abstract: The feral pigs of Ossabaw Island (USA) have an outstanding propensity to obesity and develop complete metabolic syndrome (MetS) upon prolonged high energy dieting. We now report the first high quality genome of the Ossabaw pig with Contig N50 of approximately 6.03 Mb, significantly higher than most other published pig genomes. Genomic comparison to Duroc reveals that variations including SNPs, INDELs and one approximately 2 Mb inversion identified in Ossabaw pig may be related to its "thrifty" phenotype. Finally, an important positively selected gene (PSG) was found to be LEPR (leptin receptor) containing two positively selected sites which may lead to pseudogenization of this gene with possible significant effects on obesity and inflammation development. This work provides the first complete mapping of a genome representing a naturally 'feast and famine' evolved phenotype of MetS, serving as a blueprint to guide the search for new targets and new biomarkers for obesity comorbidities.

Abstract: The ancestors of marine mammals once roamed the land and independently committed to an aquatic lifestyle. These macroevolutionary transitions have intrigued scientists for centuries. Here, we generated high-quality genome assemblies of 17 marine mammals (11 cetaceans and six pinnipeds), including eight assemblies at the chromosome level. Incorporating previously published data, we reconstructed the marine mammal phylogeny and population histories and identified numerous idiosyncratic and convergent genomic variations that possibly contributed to the transition from land to water in marine mammal lineages. Genes associated with the formation of blubber (NFIA), vascular development (SEMA3E), and heat production by brown adipose tissue (UCP1) had unique changes that may contribute to marine mammal thermoregulation. We also observed many lineage-specific changes in the marine mammals, including genes associated with deep diving and navigation. Our study advances understanding of the timing, pattern, and molecular changes associated with the evolution of mammalian lineages adapting to aquatic life.

Abstract: MOTIVATION: Achieving a near complete understanding of how the genome of an individual affects the phenotypes of that individual requires deciphering the order of variations along homologous chromosomes in species with diploid genomes. However, true diploid assembly of long-range haplotypes remains challenging. RESULTS: To address this, we have developed Haplotype-resolved Assembly for Synthetic long reads using a Trio-binning strategy, or HAST, which uses parental information to classify reads into maternal or paternal. Once sorted, these reads are used to independently de novo assemble the parent-specific haplotypes. We applied HAST to cobarcoded second-generation sequencing data from an Asian individual, resulting in a haplotype assembly covering 94.7% of the reference genome with a scaffold N50 longer than 11 Mb. The high haplotyping precision ( approximately 99.7%) and recall ( approximately 95.9%) represents a substantial improvement over the commonly used tool for assembling cobarcoded reads (Supernova), and is comparable to a trio-binning-based third generation long-read-based assembly method (TrioCanu) but with a significantly higher single-base accuracy [up to 99.99997% (Q65)]. This makes HAST a superior tool for accurate haplotyping and future haplotype-based studies. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The code of the analysis is available at https://github.com/BGI-Qingdao/HAST. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.

Abstract: The design of CRISPR gRNAs requires accurate on-target efficiency predictions, which demand high-quality gRNA activity data and efficient modeling. To advance, we here report on the generation of on-target gRNA activity data for 10,592 SpCas9 gRNAs. Integrating these with complementary published data, we train a deep learning model, CRISPRon, on 23,902 gRNAs. Compared to existing tools, CRISPRon exhibits significantly higher prediction performances on four test datasets not overlapping with training data used for the development of these tools. Furthermore, we present an interactive gRNA design webserver based on the CRISPRon standalone software, both available via https://rth.dk/resources/crispr/ . CRISPRon advances CRISPR applications by providing more accurate gRNA efficiency predictions than the existing tools.

Abstract: Lettuce (Lactuca sativa) is an important vegetable crop worldwide. Cultivated lettuce is believed to be domesticated from L. serriola; however, its origins and domestication history remain to be elucidated. Here, we sequenced a total of 445 Lactuca accessions, including major lettuce crop types and wild relative species, and generated a comprehensive map of lettuce genome variations. In-depth analyses of population structure and demography revealed that lettuce was first domesticated near the Caucasus, which was marked by loss of seed shattering. We also identified the genetic architecture of other domestication traits and wild introgressions in major resistance clusters in the lettuce genome. This study provides valuable genomic resources for crop breeding and sheds light on the domestication history of cultivated lettuce.

Abstract: Despite being the world's third largest ocean, the Indian Ocean is one of the least studied and understood with respect to microbial diversity as well as biogeochemical and ecological functions. In this study, we investigated the microbial community and its metabolic potential for nitrogen (N) acquisition in the oligotrophic surface waters of the Indian Ocean using a metagenomic approach. Proteobacteria and Cyanobacteria dominated the microbial community with an average 37.85 and 23.56% of relative abundance, respectively, followed by Bacteroidetes (3.73%), Actinobacteria (1.69%), Firmicutes (0.76%), Verrucomicrobia (0.36%), and Planctomycetes (0.31%). Overall, only 24.3% of functional genes were common among all sampling stations indicating a high level of gene diversity. However, the presence of 82.6% common KEGG Orthology (KOs) in all samples showed high functional redundancy across the Indian Ocean. Temperature, phosphate, silicate and pH were important environmental factors regulating the microbial distribution in the Indian Ocean. The cyanobacterial genus Prochlorococcus was abundant with an average 17.4% of relative abundance in the surface waters, and while 54 Prochlorococcus genomes were detected, 53 were grouped mainly within HLII clade. In total, 179 of 234 Prochlorococcus sequences extracted from the global ocean dataset were clustered into HL clades and exhibited less divergence, but 55 sequences of LL clades presented more divergence exhibiting different branch length. The genes encoding enzymes related to ammonia metabolism, such as urease, glutamate dehydrogenase, ammonia transporter, and nitrilase presented higher abundances than the genes involved in inorganic N assimilation in both microbial community and metagenomic Prochlorococcus population. Furthermore, genes associated with dissimilatory nitrate reduction, denitrification, nitrogen fixation, nitrification and anammox were absent in metagenome Prochlorococcus population, i.e., nitrogenase and nitrate reductase. Notably, the de novo biosynthesis pathways of six different amino acids were incomplete in the metagenomic Prochlorococcus population and Prochlorococcus genomes, suggesting compensatory uptake of these amino acids from the environment. These results reveal the features of the taxonomic and functional structure of the Indian Ocean microbiome and their adaptive strategies to ambient N deficiency in the oligotrophic ocean.

Abstract: Lungfishes are the closest extant relatives of tetrapods and preserve ancestral traits linked with the water-to-land transition. However, their huge genome sizes have hindered understanding of this key transition in evolution. Here, we report a 40-Gb chromosome-level assembly of the African lungfish (Protopterus annectens) genome, which is the largest genome assembly ever reported and has a contig and chromosome N50 of 1.60 Mb and 2.81 Gb, respectively. The large size of the lungfish genome is due mainly to retrotransposons. Genes with ultra-long length show similar expression levels to other genes, indicating that lungfishes have evolved high transcription efficacy to keep gene expression balanced. Together with transcriptome and experimental data, we identified potential genes and regulatory elements related to such terrestrial adaptation traits as pulmonary surfactant, anxiolytic ability, pentadactyl limbs, and pharyngeal remodeling. Our results provide insights and key resources for understanding the evolutionary pathway leading from fishes to humans.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The subfamily Bambusoideae belongs to the grass family Poaceae and has significant roles in culture, economy, and ecology. However, the phylogenetic relationships based on large-scale chloroplast genomes (CpGenomes) were elusive. Moreover, most of the chloroplast DNA sequencing methods cannot meet the requirements of large-scale CpGenome sequencing, which greatly limits and impedes the in-depth research of plant genetics and evolution. RESULTS: To develop a set of bamboo probes, we used 99 high-quality CpGenomes with 6 bamboo CpGenomes as representative species for the probe design, and assembled 15 M unique sequences as the final pan-chloroplast genome. A total of 180,519 probes for chloroplast DNA fragments were designed and synthesized by a novel hybridization-based targeted enrichment approach. Another 468 CpGenomes were selected as test data to verify the quality of the newly synthesized probes and the efficiency of the probes for chloroplast capture. We then successfully applied the probes to synthesize, enrich, and assemble 358 non-redundant CpGenomes of woody bamboo in China. Evaluation analysis showed the probes may be applicable to chloroplasts in Magnoliales, Pinales, Poales et al. Moreover, we reconstructed a phylogenetic tree of 412 bamboos (358 in-house and 54 published), supporting a non-monophyletic lineage of the genus Phyllostachys. Additionally, we shared our data by uploading a dataset of bamboo CpGenome into CNGB ( https://db.cngb.org/search/project/CNP0000502/ ) to enrich resources and promote the development of bamboo phylogenetics. CONCLUSIONS: The development of the CpGenome enrichment pipeline and its performance on bamboos recommended an inexpensive, high-throughput, time-saving and efficient CpGenome sequencing strategy, which can be applied to facilitate the phylogenetics analysis of most green plants.

Abstract: We report characteristics of soybean genetic diversity and structure from the resequencing of 481 diverse soybean accessions, comprising 52 wild (Glycine soja) selections and 429 cultivated (Glycine max) varieties (landraces and elites). This data was used to identify 7.8 million SNPs, to predict SNP effects relative to genic regions, and to identify the genetic structure, relationships, and linkage disequilibrium. We found evidence of distinct, mostly independent selection of lineages by particular geographic location. Among cultivated varieties, we identified numerous highly conserved regions, suggesting selection during domestication. Comparisons of these accessions against the whole U.S. germplasm genotyped with the SoySNP50K iSelect BeadChip revealed that over 95% of the re-sequenced accessions have a high similarity to their SoySNP50K counterparts. Probable errors in seed source or genotype tracking were also identified in approximately 5% of the accessions.

Abstract: There are more than 100 species of American didelphid marsupials (opossums and mouse opossums). Limited genomic resources for didelphids exists, with only two publicly available genome assemblies compared with dozens in the case of their Australasian counterparts. This discrepancy impedes evolutionary and ecological research. To address this gap, we assembled a high-quality chromosome-level genome of the agile gracile mouse opossum (Gracilinanus agilis) using a combination of stLFR sequencing, polishing with mate-pair data, and anchoring onto pseudochromosomes using Hi-C. This species employs a rare life-history strategy, semelparity, and all G. agilis males and most females die at the end of their first breeding season after succumbing to stress and exhaustion. The 3.7-Gb chromosome-level assembly, with 92.6% anchored onto pseudochromosomes, has a scaffold N50 of 683.5 Mb and a contig N50 of 56.9 kb. The genome assembly shows high completeness, with a mammalian BUSCO score of 88.1%. Around 49.7% of the genome contains repetitive elements. Gene annotation yielded 24,425 genes, of which 83.9% were functionally annotated. The G. agilis genome is an important resource for future studies of marsupial biology, evolution, and conservation.

Abstract: Mangroves are one of the most productive and biologically diverse ecosystems, with unique plants, animals, and microorganisms adapted to the harsh coastal environments. Although fungi are widely distributed in the mangrove ecosystem and they are playing an important role in the decomposition of organic matter, their genomic profiles are still poorly understood. In this study, we isolated seven Ascomycota fungi (Westerdykella dispersa F012, Trichoderma lixii F014, Aspergillus tubingensis F023, Penicillium brefeldianum F032, Neoroussoella solani F033, Talaromyces fuscoviridis F034, and Arthrinium marii F035) from rhizospheres of two mangroves of Kandelia obovata and Acanthus ilicifolius. We sequenced and assembled the whole genome of these fungi, resulting in size ranging from 29 to 48 Mb, while contig N50 from 112 to 833 Kb. We generated six novel fungi genomes except A. tubingensis, and the gene completeness and genome completeness of all seven genomes are higher than 94%. Comparing with non-mangrove fungi, we found Carbohydrate-Binding Modules (CBM32), a subfamily of carbohydrate active enzymes, only detected in two mangrove fungi. Another two subfamilies, Glycoside Hydrolases (GH6) and Polysaccharide Lyases (PL4), were significantly different in gene copy number between K. obovata and A. ilicifolius rhizospheres (P-value 0.041 for GH6, 0.047 for PL4). These findings may indicate an important influence of mangrove environments or hosts on the ability of decomposition in rhizosphere fungi. Secondary metabolite biosynthesis gene clusters were detected and we found the mangrove fungi averagely contain 18 Type I Polyketide (t1pks) synthase, which was significantly higher than 13 in non-mangrove fungi (P-value 0.048), suggesting their potential roles in producing bioactive compounds that important for fungi development and ecology. We reported seven mangrove-associated fungal genomes in this study and compared their carbohydrate active enzymes and secondary metabolites (SM) genes with those of non-mangrove fungi, and the results suggest that there are differences in genetic information among fungi in different habitats.

Abstract: Sex chromosomes are a peculiar constituent of the genome because the evolutionary forces that fix the primary sex-determining gene cause genic degeneration and accumulation of junk DNA in the heterogametic partner. One of the most spectacular phenomena in sex chromosome evolution is the occurrence of neo-Y chromosomes, which lead to X1X2Y sex-determining systems. Such neo-sex chromosomes are critical for understanding the processes of sex chromosome evolution because they rejuvenate their total gene content. We assembled the male and female genomes at the chromosome level of the spotted knifejaw (Oplegnathus punctatus), which has a cytogenetically recognized neo-Y chromosome. The full assembly and annotation of all three sex chromosomes allowed us to reconstruct their evolutionary history. Contrary to other neo-Y chromosomes, the fusion to X2 is quite ancient, estimated at 48 Ma. Despite its old age and being even older in the X1 homologous region which carries a huge inversion that occurred as early as 55-48 Ma, genetic degeneration of the neo-Y appears to be only moderate. Transcriptomic analysis showed that sex chromosomes harbor 87 genes, which may serve important functions in the testis. The accumulation of such male-beneficial genes, a large inversion on the X1 homologous region and fusion to X2 appear to be the main drivers of neo-Y evolution in the spotted knifejaw. The availability of high-quality assemblies of the neo-Y and both X chromosomes make this fish an ideal model for a better understanding of the variability of sex determination mechanisms and of sex chromosome evolution.

Abstract: The axolotl, Ambystoma mexicanum, has extraordinary capability to fully recover multiple tissues after lost, whereas such capability has disappeared in mammals. Thus, deciphering detailed mechanisms underlying axolotl regeneration could provide valuable lessons for regenerative medicine. However, many questions, such as the origin of essential progenitor cells and key responses of individual types of cells for regeneration remain elusive (Haas and Whited, 2017). Newly developed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) method enables researchers to observe cellular and molecular dynamics in axolotl regeneration at the single-cell resolution (Gerber et al., 2018; Leigh et al., 2018), but the reported transcriptome landscapes are only for certain cell types or in certain regenerative stages. A complete overview of the regeneration process for all cell types is still lacking.

To this end, we performed axolotl limb amputation followed by scRNA-seq (10× Genomics) on upper forearm tissues at the homeostatic stage (uninjured control, 0 h), and 7 regeneration stages (3 h–33 d) (Fig. 1A, Supplementary Material). In total, we obtained high-quality sequencing data for over 41,000 cells (Table S1). After clustering all cells and reflecting them in uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP), we identified 12 putative cell types expressing specific markers (Figs. 1B and S1A; Table S2), which were further confirmed by differentially expressed genes (DEG) analysis (Fig. S1B). By performing integrative comparison of our dataset with ones from Gerber et al. and Leigh et al. (Gerber et al., 2018; Leigh et al., 2018), we found a remarkable similarity of cell-type distribution between our and Leigh et al.’s data (Fig. S2A and S2B), thus further supporting the reproducibility of our experimental procedure.

Abstract: Chloranthales remain the last major mesangiosperm lineage without a nuclear genome assembly. We therefore assemble a high-quality chromosome-level genome of Chloranthus spicatus to resolve enigmatic evolutionary relationships, as well as explore patterns of genome evolution among the major lineages of mesangiosperms (eudicots, monocots, magnoliids, Chloranthales, and Ceratophyllales). We find that synteny is highly conserved between genomic regions of Amborella, Vitis, and Chloranthus. We identify an ancient single whole-genome duplication (WGD) (kappa) prior to the divergence of extant Chloranthales. Phylogenetic inference shows Chloranthales as sister to magnoliids. Furthermore, our analyses indicate that ancient hybridization may account for the incongruent phylogenetic placement of Chloranthales + magnoliids relative to monocots and eudicots in nuclear and chloroplast trees. Long genes and long introns are found to be prevalent in both Chloranthales and magnoliids compared to other angiosperms. Overall, our findings provide an improved context for understanding mesangiosperm relationships and evolution and contribute a valuable genomic resource for future investigations.
Chloranthales remain the last lineage of core angiosperms that lacks a nuclear genome assembly. Here, the authors report the genome assembly of Chloranthus spicatus and show its contribution to deepen our understanding on diversification, phylogeny, and genome evolution in angiosperms.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Synthetic long reads (SLR) with long-range co-barcoding information are now widely applied in genomics research. Although several tools have been developed for each specific SLR technique, a robust standalone scaffolder with high efficiency is warranted for hybrid genome assembly. RESULTS: In this work, we developed a standalone scaffolding tool, SLR-superscaffolder, to link together contigs in draft assemblies using co-barcoding and paired-end read information. Our top-to-bottom scheme first builds a global scaffold graph based on Jaccard Similarity to determine the order and orientation of contigs, and then locally improves the scaffolds with the aid of paired-end information. We also exploited a screening algorithm to reduce the negative effect of misassembled contigs in the input assembly. We applied SLR-superscaffolder to a human single tube long fragment read sequencing dataset and increased the scaffold NG50 of its corresponding draft assembly 1349 fold. Moreover, benchmarking on different input contigs showed that this approach overall outperformed existing SLR scaffolders, providing longer contiguity and fewer misassemblies, especially for short contigs assembled by next-generation sequencing data. The open-source code of SLR-superscaffolder is available at https://github.com/BGI-Qingdao/SLR-superscaffolder . CONCLUSIONS: SLR-superscaffolder can dramatically improve the contiguity of a draft assembly by integrating a hybrid assembly strategy.

Abstract: Extant giant pandas are divided into Sichuan and Qinling subspecies. The giant panda has many species-specific characteristics, including comparatively small organs for body size, small genitalia of male individuals, and low reproduction. Here, we report the most contiguous, high-quality chromosome-level genomes of two extant giant panda subspecies to date, with the first genome assembly of the Qinling subspecies. Compared with the previously assembled giant panda genomes based on short reads, our two assembled genomes increased contiguity over 200-fold at the contig level. Additional sequencing of 25 individuals dated the divergence of the Sichuan and Qinling subspecies into two distinct clusters from 10,000 to 12,000 years ago. Comparative genomic analyses identified the loss of regulatory elements in the dachshund family transcription factor 2 (DACH2) gene and specific changes in the synaptotagmin 6 (SYT6) gene, which may be responsible for the reduced fertility of the giant panda. Positive selection anal-ysis between the two subspecies indicated that the reproduction-associated IQ motif containing D (IQCD) gene may at least partly explain the different reproduction rates of the two subspecies. Furthermore, sev-eral genes in the Hippo pathway exhibited signs of rapid evolution with giant panda-specific variants and divergent regulatory elements, which may contribute to the reduced inner organ sizes of the giant panda.

Abstract: Many fungi form persistent and dormant sclerotia with compact hardened mycelia during unfavorable circumstances. While most of these sclerotia are small in size, Wolfiporia cocos, a wood-decay fungus, grows into giant sclerotia, which are mainly composed of polysaccharides of linear (1-->3)-beta-D-glucans. To explore the underlying mechanism of converting sophisticated wood polysaccharides for biosynthesis of highly homogenized glucans in W. cocos, we sequenced and assembled the genome of a cultivated W. cocos strain (WCLT) in China. The 62-Mb haploid genome contains 44.2% repeat sequences, of which, 48.0% are transposable elements (TEs). Contrary to the genome of W. cocos from North America, WCLT has independently undergone a partial genome duplication (PGD) event. The large-scale TE insertion and PGD occurrence overlapped with an archeological Pleistocene stage of low oxygen and high temperature, and these stresses might have induced the differences in sclerotium due to geographical distribution. The wood decomposition enzymes, as well as sclerotium-regulator kinases, aquaporins, and highly expanded gene families such as NAD-related families, together with actively expressed 1,3-beta-glucan synthase for sclerotium polysaccharides, all have contributed to the sclerotium formation and expansion. This study shall inspire further exploration on how fungi convert wood into simple glucans in the sclerotium of W. cocos.

Abstract: Tumor multiregion sequencing reveals intratumor heterogeneity (ITH) and clonal evolution playing a key role in tumor progression and metastases. Large-scale high-depth multiregional sequencing of colorectal cancer, comparative analysis among patients with right-sided colon cancer (RCC), left-sided colon cancer (LCC), and rectal cancer (RC), as well as the study of lymph node metastasis (LN) with extranodal tumor deposits (ENTDs) from evolutionary perspective remain weakly explored. Here, we recruited 68 patients with RCC (18), LCC (20), and RC (30). We performed high-depth whole-exome sequencing of 206 tumor regions including 176 primary tumors, 19 LN, and 11 ENTD samples. Our results showed ITH with a Darwinian pattern of evolution and the evolution pattern of LCC and RC was more complex and divergent than RCC. Genetic and evolutionary evidences found that both LN and ENTD originated from different clones. Moreover, ENTD was a distinct entity from LN and evolved later.

Abstract: Long-lived rodents have become an attractive model for the studies on aging. To understand evolutionary paths to long life, we prepare chromosome-level genome assemblies of the two longest-lived rodents, Canadian beaver (Castor canadensis) and naked mole rat (NMR, Heterocephalus glaber), which were scaffolded with in vitro proximity ligation and chromosome conformation capture data and complemented with long-read sequencing. Our comparative genomic analyses reveal that amino acid substitutions at "disease-causing" sites are widespread in the rodent genomes and that identical substitutions in long-lived rodents are associated with common adaptive phenotypes, e.g., enhanced resistance to DNA damage and cellular stress. By employing a newly developed substitution model and likelihood ratio test, we find that energy and fatty acid metabolism pathways are enriched for signals of positive selection in both long-lived rodents. Thus, the high-quality genome resource of long-lived rodents can assist in the discovery of genetic factors that control longevity and adaptive evolution.

Abstract: Chondrichthyan (cartilaginous fish) occupies a key phylogenetic position and is important for investigating evolutionary processes of vertebrates. However, limited whole genomes impede our in-depth knowledge of important issues such as chromosome evolution and immunity. Here, we report the chromosome-level genome of white-spotted bamboo shark. Combing it with other shark genomes, we reconstructed 16 ancestral chromosomes of bamboo shark and illustrate a dynamic chromosome rearrangement process. We found that genes on 13 fast-evolving chromosomes can be enriched in immune-related pathways. And two chromosomes contain important genes that can be used to develop single-chain antibodies, which were shown to have high affinity to human disease markers by using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. We also found three bone formation-related genes were lost due to chromosome rearrangements. Our study highlights the importance of chromosome rearrangements, providing resources for understanding of cartilaginous fish diversification and potential application of single-chain antibodies.

Abstract: The Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin (Sousa chinensis) is a small inshore species of odontocete cetacean listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List. Here, we report on the evolution of S. chinensis chromosomes from its cetruminant ancestor and elucidate the evolutionary history and population genetics of two neighboring S. chinensis populations. We found that breakpoints in ancestral chromosomes leading to S. chinensis could have affected the function of genes related to kidney filtration, body development, and immunity. Resequencing of individuals from two neighboring populations in the northwestern South China Sea, Leizhou Bay and Sanniang Bay, revealed genetic differentiation, low diversity, and small contemporary effective population sizes. Demographic analyses showed a marked decrease in the population size of the two investigated populations over the last similar to 4,000 years, possibly related to climatic oscillations. This study implies a high risk of extinction and strong conservation requirement for the Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The scaly-foot snail (Chrysomallon squamiferum) is highly adapted to deep-sea hydrothermal vents and has drawn much interest since its discovery. However, the limited information on its genome has impeded further related research and understanding of its adaptation to deep-sea hydrothermal vents. FINDINGS: Here, we report the whole-genome sequencing and assembly of the scaly-foot snail and another snail (Gigantopelta aegis), which inhabits similar environments. Using Oxford Nanopore Technology, 10X Genomics, and Hi-C technologies, we obtained a chromosome-level genome of C. squamiferum with an N50 size of 20.71 Mb. By constructing a phylogenetic tree, we found that these 2 deep-sea snails evolved independently of other snails. Their divergence from each other occurred approximately 66.3 million years ago. Comparative genomic analysis showed that different snails have diverse genome sizes and repeat contents. Deep-sea snails have more DNA transposons and long terminal repeats but fewer long interspersed nuclear elements than other snails. Gene family analysis revealed that deep-sea snails experienced stronger selective pressures than freshwater snails, and gene families related to the nervous system, immune system, metabolism, DNA stability, antioxidation, and biomineralization were significantly expanded in scaly-foot snails. We also found 251 H-2 Class II histocompatibility antigen, A-U alpha chain-like (H2-Aal) genes, which exist uniquely in the Gigantopelta aegis genome. This finding is important for investigating the evolution of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) genes. CONCLUSION: Our study provides new insights into deep-sea snail genomes and valuable resources for further studies.

Abstract: Allele-specific protospacer adjacent motif (asPAM)-positioning SNPs and CRISPRs are valuable resources for gene therapy of dominant disorders. However, one technical hurdle is to identify the haplotype comprising the disease-causing allele and the distal asPAM SNPs. Here, we describe a novel CRISPR-based method (CRISPR-hapC) for haplotyping. Based on the generation (with a pair of CRISPRs) of extrachromosomal circular DNA in cells, the CRISPR-hapC can map haplotypes from a few hundred bases to over 200 Mb. To streamline and demonstrate the applicability of the CRISPR-hapC and asPAM CRISPR for allele-specific gene editing, we reanalyzed the 1000 human pan-genome and generated a high frequency asPAM SNP and CRISPR database (www.crispratlas.com/knockout) for four CRISPR systems (SaCas9, SpCas9, xCas9 and Cas12a). Using the huntingtin (HTT) CAG expansion and transthyretin (TTR) exon 2 mutation as examples, we showed that the asPAM CRISPRs can specifically discriminate active and dead PAMs for all 23 loci tested. Combination of the CRISPR-hapC and asPAM CRISPRs further demonstrated the capability for achieving highly accurate and haplotype-specific deletion of the HTT CAG expansion allele and TTR exon 2 mutation in human cells. Taken together, our study provides a new approach and an important resource for genome research and allele- specific (haplotype-specific) gene therapy.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Analyses that use genome assemblies are critically affected by the contiguity, completeness, and accuracy of those assemblies. In recent years single-molecule sequencing techniques generating long-read information have become available and enabled substantial improvement in contig length and genome completeness, especially for large genomes (>100 Mb), although bioinformatic tools for these applications are still limited. FINDINGS: We developed a software tool to close sequence gaps in genome assemblies, TGS-GapCloser, that uses low-depth ( approximately 10x) long single-molecule reads. The algorithm extracts reads that bridge gap regions between 2 contigs within a scaffold, error corrects only the candidate reads, and assigns the best sequence data to each gap. As a demonstration, we used TGS-GapCloser to improve the scaftig NG50 value of 3 human genome assemblies by 24-fold on average with only approximately 10x coverage of Oxford Nanopore or Pacific Biosciences reads, covering with sequence data up to 94.8% gaps with 97.7% positive predictive value. These improved assemblies achieve 99.998% (Q46) single-base accuracy with final inserted sequences having 99.97% (Q35) accuracy, despite the high raw error rate of single-molecule reads, enabling high-quality downstream analyses, including up to a 31-fold increase in the scaftig NGA50 and up to 13.1% more complete BUSCO genes. Additionally, we show that even in ultra-large genome assemblies, such as the ginkgo ( approximately 12 Gb), TGS-GapCloser can cover 71.6% of gaps with sequence data. CONCLUSIONS: TGS-GapCloser can close gaps in large genome assemblies using raw long reads quickly and cost-effectively. The final assemblies generated by TGS-GapCloser have improved contiguity and completeness while maintaining high accuracy. The software is available at https://github.com/BGI-Qingdao/TGS-GapCloser.

Abstract: Mounting evidence suggests that terrestrialization of plants started in streptophyte green algae, favoured by their dual existence in freshwater and subaerial/terrestrial environments. Here, we present the genomes of Mesostigma viride and Chlorokybus atmophyticus, two sister taxa in the earliest-diverging clade of streptophyte algae dwelling in freshwater and subaerial/terrestrial environments, respectively. We provide evidence that the common ancestor of M. viride and C. atmophyticus (and thus of streptophytes) had already developed traits associated with a subaerial/terrestrial environment, such as embryophyte-type photorespiration, canonical plant phytochrome, several phytohormones and transcription factors involved in responses to environmental stresses, and evolution of cellulose synthase and cellulose synthase-like genes characteristic of embryophytes. Both genomes differed markedly in genome size and structure, and in gene family composition, revealing their dynamic nature, presumably in response to adaptations to their contrasting environments. The ancestor of M. viride possibly lost several genomic traits associated with a subaerial/terrestrial environment following transition to a freshwater habitat.

Abstract: Mekong tiger perch (Datnioides undecimradiatus) is an ornamental and vulnerable freshwater fish native to the Mekong basin in Indochina, belonging to the order Lobotiformes. Here, we generated 121X stLFR co-barcode clean reads and 18X Oxford Nanopore MinION reads and obtained a 595Mb Mekong tiger perch genome, which is the first whole genome sequence in the order Lobotiformes. Based on this genome, the phylogenetic tree analysis suggested that Lobotiformes is more closely related to Sciaenidae than to Tetraodontiformes, resolving a long-time dispute. We depicted the genes involved in pigment development in Mekong tiger perch and results confirmed that the four rate-limiting genes of pigment synthesis had been retained after fish-specific genome duplication. We also estimated the demographic history of Mekong tiger perch, which showed that the effective population size suffered a continuous reduction possibly related to the contraction of immune-related genes. Our study provided a reference genome resource for the Lobotiformes, as well as insights into the phylogenetic position of Lobotiformes and biological conservation.

Abstract: The brain, with its diverse physiology and intricate cellular organization, is the most complex organ of the mammalian body. To expand our basic understanding of the neurobiology of the brain and its diseases, we performed a comprehensive molecular dissection of 10 major brain regions and multiple subregions using a variety of transcriptomics methods and antibody-based mapping. This analysis was carried out in the human, pig, and mouse brain to allow the identification of regional expression profiles, as well as to study similarities and differences in expression levels between the three species. The resulting data have been made available in an open-access Brain Atlas resource, part of the Human Protein Atlas, to allow exploration and comparison of the expression of individual protein-coding genes in various parts of the mammalian brain.

Abstract: Hybrids are extensively used in agriculture to deliver an increase in yield, yet the molecular basis of heterosis is not well understood. Global DNA methylation analysis, transcriptome analysis and small RNA profiling were aimed to understand the epigenetic effect of the changes in gene expression level in the two hybrids and their parental lines. Increased DNA methylation was observed in both the hybrids as compared to their parents. This increased DNA methylation in hybrids showed that majority of the 24-nt siRNA clusters had higher expression in hybrids than the parents. Transcriptome analysis revealed that various phytohormones (auxin and salicylic acid) responsive hybrid-MPV DEGs were significantly altered in both the hybrids in comparison to MPV. DEGs associated with plant immunity and growth were overexpressed whereas DEGs associated with basal defence level were repressed. This antagonistic patterns of gene expression might contribute to the greater growth of the hybrids. It was also noticed that some common as well as unique changes in the regulatory pathways were associated with heterotic growth in both the hybrids. Approximately 70% and 67% of down-regulated hybrid-MPV DEGs were found to be differentially methylated in ICPH 2671 and ICPH 2740 hybrid, respectively. This reflected the association of epigenetic regulation in altered gene expressions. Our findings also revealed that miRNAs might play important roles in hybrid vigour in both the hybrids by regulating their target genes, especially in controlling plant growth and development, defence and stress response pathways. The above finding provides an insight into the molecular mechanism of pigeonpea heterosis.

Abstract: Mangroves are a group of plant species that occupy the coastal intertidal zone and are major components of this ecologically important ecosystem. Mangroves belong to about twenty diverse families. Here, we sequenced and assembled chloroplast genomes of 14 mangrove species from eight families spanning five rosid orders and one asterid order: Fabales (Pongamia pinnata), Lamiales (Avicennia marina), Malpighiales (Excoecaria agallocha, Bruguiera sexangula, Kandelia obovata, Rhizophora stylosa, and Ceriops tagal), Malvales (Hibiscus tiliaceus, Heritiera littoralis, and Thespesia populnea), Myrtales (Laguncularia racemosa, Sonneratia ovata, and Pemphis acidula), and Sapindales (Xylocarpus moluccensis). These chloroplast genomes range from 149 kb to 168 kb in length. A conserved structure of two inverted repeats (IRa and IRb, ~25.8 kb), one large single-copy region (LSC, ~89.0 kb), and one short single-copy region (SSC, ~18.9 kb) as well as ~130 genes (85 protein-coding, 37 tRNAs, and 8 rRNAs) was observed. We found the lowest divergence in the IR regions among the four regions. We also identified simple sequence repeats (SSRs), which were found to be variable in numbers. Most chloroplast genes are highly conserved, with only four genes under positive selection or relaxed pressure. Combined with publicly available chloroplast genomes, we carried out phylogenetic analysis and confirmed the previously reported phylogeny within rosids, including the positioning of obscure families in Malpighiales. Our study reports 14 mangrove chloroplast genomes and illustrates their genome features and evolution.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: DNBSEQ platforms are new massively parallel sequencing (MPS) platforms that use DNA nanoball technology. Use of data generated from DNBSEQ platforms to detect single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and small insertions and deletions (indels) has proven to be quite effective, while the feasibility of copy number variants (CNVs) detection is unclear. RESULTS: Here, we first benchmarked different CNV detection tools based on Illumina whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data of NA12878 and then assessed these tools in CNV detection based on DNBSEQ sequencing data from the same sample. When the same tool was used, the CNVs detected based on DNBSEQ and Illumina data were similar in quantity, length and distribution, while great differences existed within results from different tools and even based on data from a single platform. We further estimated the CNV detection power based on available CNV benchmarks of NA12878 and found similar precision and sensitivity between the DNBSEQ and Illumina platforms. We also found higher precision of CNVs shorter than 1 kbp based on DNBSEQ platforms than those based on Illumina platforms by using Pindel, DELLY and LUMPY. We carefully compared these two available benchmarks and found a large proportion of specific CNVs between them. Thus, we constructed a more complete CNV benchmark of NA12878 containing 3512 CNV regions. CONCLUSIONS: We assessed and benchmarked CNV detections based on WGS with DNBSEQ platforms and provide guidelines for future studies.

Abstract: Nyssa yunnanensis is a deciduous tree species in the family Nyssaceae within the order Cornales. As only eight individual trees and two populations have been recorded in China's Yunnan province, this species has been listed among China's national Class I protection species since 1999 and also among 120 PSESP (Plant Species with Extremely Small Populations) in the Implementation Plan of Rescuing and Conserving China's Plant Species with Extremely Small Populations (PSESP) (2011-2-15). Here, we present the draft genome assembly of N. yunnanensis. Using 10X Genomics linked-reads sequencing data, we carried out the de novo assembly and annotation analysis. The N. yunnanensis genome assembly is 1475 Mb in length, containing 288,519 scaffolds with a scaffold N50 length of 985.59 kb. Within the assembled genome, 799.51 Mb was identified as repetitive elements, accounting for 54.24% of the sequenced genome, and a total of 39,803 protein-coding genes were predicted. With the genomic characteristics of N. yunnanensis available, our study might facilitate future conservation biology studies to help protect this extremely threatened tree species.

Abstract: Anglerfishes are a highly diverse group of species with unique characteristics. Here, we report the first chromosome-level genome of a species in the order Lophiiformes, the yellow goosefish (Lophius litulon), obtained by whole genome shotgun sequencing and high-throughput chromatin conformation capture. Approximately 97.20% of the assembly spanning 709.23 Mb could be anchored to 23 chromosomes with a contig N50 of 164.91 kb. The BUSCO value was 95.4%, suggesting that the quality of the assembly was high. A comparative gene family analysis identified expanded and contracted gene families, and these may be associated with adaptation to the benthic environment and the lack of scales in the species. A majority of positively selected genes were related to metabolic processes, suggesting that digestive and metabolic system evolution expanded the diversity of yellow goosefish prey. Our study provides a valuable genetic resource for understanding the mechanisms underlying the unique features of the yellow goosefish and for investigating anglerfish evolution.

Abstract: The rubber tree, Hevea brasiliensis, produces natural rubber that serves as an essential industrial raw material. Here, we present a high-quality reference genome for a rubber tree cultivar GT1 using single-molecule real-time sequencing (SMRT) and Hi-C technologies to anchor the similar to 1.47-Gb genome assembly into 18 pseudochromosomes. The chromosome-based genome analysis enabled us to establish a model of spurge chromosome evolution, since the common paleopolyploid event occurred before the split of Hevea and Manihot. We show recent and rapid bursts of the three Hevea-specific LTR-retrotransposon families during the last 10 million years, leading to the massive expansion by similar to 65.88% (similar to 970 Mbp) of the whole rubber tree genome since the divergence from Manihot. We identify large-scale expansion of genes associated with whole rubber biosynthesis processes, such as basal metabolic processes, ethylene biosynthesis, and the activation of polysaccharide and glycoprotein lectin, which are important properties for latex production. A map of genomic variation between the cultivated and wild rubber trees was obtained, which contains similar to 15.7 million high-quality single-nucleotide polymorphisms. We identified hundreds of candidate domestication genes with drastically lowered genomic diversity in the cultivated but not wild rubber trees despite a relatively short domestication history of rubber tree, some of which are involved in rubber biosynthesis. This genome assembly represents key resources for future rubber tree research and breeding, providing novel targets for improving plant biotic and abiotic tolerance and rubber production.

Abstract: Mangroves, as important and special ecosystems, create unique ecological environments for examining the microbial gene capacity and potential for producing bioactive compounds. However, little is known about the biogeochemical implications of microbiomes in mangrove ecosystems, especially the variations between pristine and anthropogenic mangroves. To elucidate this, we investigated the microbial taxonomic and functional shifts of the mangrove microbiomes and their potential for bioactive compounds in two different coastal mangrove ecosystems in southern China. A gene catalogue, including 87 million unique genes, was constructed, based on deep shotgun metagenomic sequencing. Differentially enriched bacterial and archaeal taxa between pristine mangroves (Guangxi) and anthropogenic mangroves (Shenzhen) were found. The Nitrospira and ammonia-oxidizing archaea, specifically, were more abundant in Shenzhen mangroves, while sulfate-reducing bacteria and methanogens were more abundant in Guangxi mangroves. The results of functional analysis were consistent with the taxonomic results, indicating that the Shenzhen mangrove microbiome has a higher abundance of genes involved in nitrogen metabolism while the Guangxi mangrove microbiome has a higher capacity for sulfur metabolism and methanogenesis. Biosynthetic gene clusters were identified in the metagenome data and in hundreds of de novo reconstructed nonredundant microbial genomes, respectively. Notably, we found different biosynthetic potential in different taxa, and we identified three high quality and novel Acidobacteria genomes with a large number of BGCs. In total, 67,278 unique genes were annotated with antibiotic resistance, indicating the prevalence and persistence in multidrug-resistant genes in the mangrove microbiome.
IMPORTANCE This study comprehensively described the taxonomy and functionality of mangrove microbiomes, including their capacity for secondary metabolite biosynthesis and their ability to resist antibiotics. The microbial taxonomic and functional characteristics differed between geographical locations, corresponding to the environmental condition of two diverse mangrove regions. A large number of microbial biosynthetic gene clusters encoding novel bioactivities were found, and this can serve as a valuable resource to guide novel bioactive compound discovery for potential clinical uses.

Short Title: The genome of Prasinoderma coloniale unveils the existence of a third phylum within green plants
ISSN: 2397-334X
Abstract: Genome analysis of the pico-eukaryotic marine green alga Prasinoderma coloniale CCMP 1413 unveils the existence of a novel phylum within green plants (Viridiplantae), the Prasinodermophyta, which diverged before the split of Chlorophyta and Streptophyta. Structural features of the genome and gene family comparisons revealed an intermediate position of the P. coloniale genome (25.3 Mb) between the extremely compact, small genomes of picoplanktonic Mamiellophyceae (Chlorophyta) and the larger, more complex genomes of early-diverging streptophyte algae. Reconstruction of the minimal core genome of Viridiplantae allowed identification of an ancestral toolkit of transcription factors and flagellar proteins. Adaptations of P. coloniale to its deep-water, oligotrophic environment involved expansion of light-harvesting proteins, reduction of early light-induced proteins, evolution of a distinct type of C4 photosynthesis and carbon-concentrating mechanism, synthesis of the metal-complexing metabolite picolinic acid, and vitamin B1, B7 and B12 auxotrophy. The P. coloniale genome provides first insights into the dawn of green plant evolution.

Abstract: Osteoglossiformes is a basal clade of teleost, evolving since the Jurassic period. The genomes of Osteoglossiformes species would shed light on the evolution and adaptation of teleost. Here, we established a chromosome-level genome of African arowana. Together with the genomes of pirarucu and Asian arowana, we found that they diverged at approximately 106.1 million years ago (MYA) and approximately 59.2 MYA, respectively, which are coincident with continental separation. Interestingly, we identified a dynamic genome evolution characterized by a fast evolutionary rate and a high pseudogenization rate in African arowana and pirarucu. Additionally, more transposable elements were found in Asian arowana which confer more gene duplications. Moreover, we found the contraction of olfactory receptor and the expansion of UGT in African arowana might be related to its transformation from carnivore to be omnivore. Taken together, we provided valuable genomic resource of Osteoglossidae and revealed the correlation of biogeography and teleost evolution.

Abstract: Mangroves is an umbrella term for plants located across the tropics and sub-tropics that live in the coastal region, between the sea and the land. All mangroves evolved from terrestrial plants, providing the opportunity to assess convergence, as well as the lineage-specific features, at the genetic level. In this study, we compared chloroplast genomes from 21 mangrove species, covering main phylogenetic clades. We demonstrate that chloroplast gene order, content, and genome size is largely conserved in mangroves. The exceptions are loss of the photosystem I gene psaZ in Acanthus ilicifolius and inversion of the ribosomal protein gene rpl23 in Avicennia germinans. The repeat content of mangrove chloroplast varied between species, but was conserved within species of the same order. Sequence diversity analysis revealed that the IR (invert repeat) region was highly conserved compared to the SC (single-copy) region in most phylogenetic clades, except clade core leptosporangiates (ferns). The ribosomal protein gene rps7 was under positive selection in Kandelia obovato, Rhizophora stylosa, Bruguiera sexangular and Rhizophora mangle, a monophyletic branch of clade fabids, while no evidence of positive selection was found in other mangrove lineages. Taken together, our data suggests that convergent evolutionary dynamics leaves no significant signal on the plastid genome of mangroves. The complete chloroplast genomes provided in this study shed light on the evolution of these important plastids and provides a valuable resource for further research efforts.

Abstract: Averrhoa carambola is commonly known as star fruit because of its peculiar shape, and its fruit is a rich source of minerals and vitamins. It is also used in traditional medicines in countries such as India, China, the Philippines, and Brazil for treating various ailments, including fever, diarrhea, vomiting, and skin disease. Here, we present the first draft genome of the Oxalidaceae family, with an assembled genome size of 470.51 Mb. In total, 24,726 protein-coding genes were identified, and 16,490 genes were annotated using various well-known databases. The phylogenomic analysis confirmed the evolutionary position of the Oxalidaceae family. Based on the gene functional annotations, we also identified enzymes that may be involved in important nutritional pathways in the star fruit genome. Overall, the data from this first sequenced genome in the Oxalidaceae family provide an essential resource for nutritional, medicinal, and cultivational studies of the economically important star-fruit plant.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: With more than 30,000 species, fish-including bony, jawless, and cartilaginous fish-are the largest vertebrate group, and include some of the earliest vertebrates. Despite their critical roles in many ecosystems and human society, fish genomics lags behind work on birds and mammals. This severely limits our understanding of evolution and hinders progress on the conservation and sustainable utilization of fish. RESULTS: Here, we announce the Fish10K project, a portion of the Earth BioGenome Project aiming to sequence 10,000 representative fish genomes in a systematic fashion within 10 years, and we officially welcome collaborators to join this effort. As a step towards this goal, we herein describe a feasible workflow for the procurement and storage of biospecimens, as well as sequencing and assembly strategies. CONCLUSIONS: To illustrate, we present the genomes of 10 fish species from a cohort of 93 species chosen for technology development.

Abstract: The Chinese ginseng Panax notoginseng is a domesticated herb with significant medicinal and economic value. Here we report a chromosome-level P. notoginseng genome assembly with a high ( approximately 79%) repetitive sequence content. The juxtaposition with the widely distributed, closely related Korean ginseng (Panax ginseng) genome revealed contraction of plant defense genes (in particular R-genes) in the P. notoginseng genome. We also investigated the reasons for the larger genome size of Panax species, revealing contributions from two Panax-specific whole-genome duplication events and transposable element expansion. Transcriptome data and comparative genome analysis revealed the candidate genes involved in the ginsenoside synthesis pathway. We also performed a genome-wide association study on 240 cultivated P. notoginseng individuals and identified the associated genes with dry root weight (63 genes) and stem thickness (168 genes). The P. notoginseng genome represents a critical step toward harnessing the full potential of an economically important and enigmatic plant.

Abstract: In plants, parasitism triggers the reductive evolution of plastid genomes (plastomes). To disentangle the molecular evolutionary associations between feeding on other plants below- or aboveground and general transitions from facultative to obligate parasitism, we analyzed 34 complete plastomes of autotrophic, root- and stem-feeding hemiparasitic, and holoparasitic Santalales. We observed inexplicable losses of housekeeping genes and tRNAs in hemiparasites and dramatic genomic reconfiguration in holoparasitic Balanophoraceae, whose plastomes have exceptionally low GC contents. Genomic changes are related primarily to the evolution of hemi- or holoparasitism, whereas the transition from a root- to a stem-feeding mode plays no major role. In contrast, the rate of molecular evolution accelerates in a stepwise manner from autotrophs to root- and then stem-feeding parasites. Already the ancestral transition to root-parasitism coincides with a relaxation of selection in plastomes. Another significant selectional shift in plastid genes occurs as stem-feeders evolve, suggesting that this derived form coincides with trophic specialization despite the retention of photosynthetic capacity. Parasitic Santalales fill a gap in our understanding of parasitism-associated plastome degeneration. We reveal that lifestyle-genome associations unfold interdependently over trophic specialization and feeding mode transitions, where holoparasitic Balanophoraceae provide a system for exploring the functional realms of plastomes.

Abstract: Reference genomes are essential for metagenomic analyses and functional characterization of the human gut microbiota. We present the Culturable Genome Reference (CGR), a collection of 1,520 nonredundant, high-quality draft genomes generated from >6,000 bacteria cultivated from fecal samples of healthy humans. Of the 1,520 genomes, which were chosen to cover all major bacterial phyla and genera in the human gut, 264 are not represented in existing reference genome catalogs. We show that this increase in the number of reference bacterial genomes improves the rate of mapping metagenomic sequencing reads from 50% to >70%, enabling higher-resolution descriptions of the human gut microbiome. We use the CGR genomes to annotate functions of 338 bacterial species, showing the utility of this resource for functional studies. We also carry out a pan-genome analysis of 38 important human gut species, which reveals the diversity and specificity of functional enrichment between their core and dispensable genomes.

Abstract: As Charles Darwin anticipated, living fossils provide excellent opportunities to study evolutionary questions related to extinction, competition, and adaptation. Ginkgo (Ginkgo biloba L.) is one of the oldest living plants and a fascinating example of how people have saved a species from extinction and assisted its resurgence. By resequencing 545 genomes of ginkgo trees sampled from 51 populations across the world, we identify three refugia in China and detect multiple cycles of population expansion and reduction along with glacial admixture between relict populations in the southwestern and southern refugia. We demonstrate multiple anthropogenic introductions of ginkgo from eastern China into different continents. Further analyses reveal bioclimatic variables that have affected the geographic distribution of ginkgo and the role of natural selection in ginkgo's adaptation and resilience. These investigations provide insights into the evolutionary history of ginkgo trees and valuable genomic resources for further addressing various questions involving living fossil species.

Abstract: Plant subtilases (SBTs) are a widely distributed family of serine proteases which participates in plant developmental processes and immune responses. Although SBTs are divided into seven subgroups in plants, their origin and evolution, particularly in green algae remain elusive. Here, we present a comprehensive large-scale evolutionary analysis of all subtilases. The plant subtilases SBT1-5 were found to be monophyletic, nested within a larger radiation of bacteria suggesting that they originated from bacteria by a single horizontal gene transfer (HGT) event. A group of bacterial subtilases comprising representatives from four phyla was identified as a sister group to SBT1-5. The phylogenetic analyses, based on evaluation of novel streptophyte algal genomes, suggested that the recipient of the HGT of bacterial subtilases was the common ancestor of Coleochaetophyceae, Zygnematophyceae and embryophytes. Following the HGT, the subtilase gene duplicated in the common ancestor and the two genes diversified into SBT2 and SBT1, 3-5 respectively. Comparative structural analysis of homology-modeled SBT2 proteins also showed their conservation from bacteria to embryophytes. Our study provides the first molecular evidence about the evolution of plant subtilases via HGT followed by a first gene duplication in the common ancestor of Coleochaetophyceae, Zygnematophyceae, and embryophytes, and subsequent expansion in embryophytes.

Abstract: We provided a chromosome-length assembly of B. nigra and show the comprehensive chromosome-scale variations among Brassica genomes. Chromosome-level assembly of the Brassica species, which include many important crops, is essential for the agricultural and evolutionary studies. While the present B. nigra chromosomes was connected with genetic map of B. juncea, hindering the comparative analysis of the B chromosomes. Here we present a chromosome-length B. nigra assembly constructed with Hi-C connections and its variations on chromosome level compared with other Brassica species. We produced an assembly of 484 Mb annotated with 51,829 genes, of which 393 Mb were anchored onto 8 chromosomes, taking 81.26% of the assembly. Comparison of the B chromosomes shows high concordance of the two B. nigra assemblies and reveals comprehensive variations of the B chromosomes after polyploidization and gene loss in syntenic regions. Chromosome blocks with variations have lower gene density and higher TE content. Furthermore, we compared the chromosomes of the three major Brassica diploids, which showed that most of the variations between B and A/C had completed before A/C divergence and there are more variations on C chromosomes after their divergence. In summary, our work presents a chromosome-length assembly of B. nigra and comprehensive comparative analysis of the Brassica chromosomes, which provides a useful reference for other studies and comprehensive information of Brassica chromosome evolution.

Abstract: We report a map of 4.97 million single-nucleotide polymorphisms of the chickpea from whole-genome resequencing of 429 lines sampled from 45 countries. We identified 122 candidate regions with 204 genes under selection during chickpea breeding. Our data suggest the Eastern Mediterranean as the primary center of origin and migration route of chickpea from the Mediterranean/Fertile Crescent to Central Asia, and probably in parallel from Central Asia to East Africa (Ethiopia) and South Asia (India). Genome-wide association studies identified 262 markers and several candidate genes for 13 traits. Our study establishes a foundation for large-scale characterization of germplasm and population genomics, and a resource for trait dissection, accelerating genetic gains in future chickpea breeding.

Abstract: Background: The African eggplant (Solanum aethiopicum) is a nutritious traditional vegetable used in many African countries, including Uganda and Nigeria. It is thought to have been domesticated in Africa from its wild relative, Solanum anguivi. S. aethiopicum has been routinely used as a source of disease resistance genes for several Solanaceae crops, including Solanum melongena. A lack of genomic resources has meant that breeding of S. aethiopicum has lagged behind other vegetable crops. Results: We assembled a 1.02-Gb draft genome of S. aethiopicum, which contained predominantly repetitive sequences (78.9%). We annotated 37,681 gene models, including 34,906 protein-coding genes. Expansion of disease resistance genes was observed via 2 rounds of amplification of long terminal repeat retrotransposons, which may have occurred similar to 1.25 and 3.5 million years ago, respectively. By resequencing 65 S. aethiopicum and S. anguivi genotypes, 18,614,838 single-nucleotide polymorphisms were identified, of which 34,171 were located within disease resistance genes. Analysis of domestication and demographic history revealed active selection for genes involved in drought tolerance in both "Gilo" and "Shum" groups. A pan-genome of S. aethiopicum was assembled, containing 51,351 protein-coding genes; 7,069 of these genes were missing from the reference genome. Conclusions: The genome sequence of S. aethiopicum enhances our understanding of its biotic and abiotic resistance. The single-nucleotide polymorphisms identified are immediately available for use by breeders. The information provided here will accelerate selection and breeding of the African eggplant, as well as other crops within the Solanaceae family.

Abstract: Two of the most economically important plants in the Artocarpus genus are jackfruit (A. heterophyllus Lam.) and breadfruit (A. altilis (Parkinson) Fosberg). Both species are long-lived trees that have been cultivated for thousands of years in their native regions. Today they are grown throughout tropical to subtropical areas as an important source of starch and other valuable nutrients. There are hundreds of breadfruit varieties that are native to Oceania, of which the most commonly distributed types are seedless triploids. Jackfruit is likely native to the Western Ghats of India and produces one of the largest tree-borne fruit structures (reaching up to 45 kg). To-date, there is limited genomic information for these two economically important species. Here, we generated 273 Gb and 227 Gb of raw data from jackfruit and breadfruit, respectively. The high-quality reads from jackfruit were assembled into 162,440 scaffolds totaling 982 Mb with 35,858 genes. Similarly, the breadfruit reads were assembled into 180,971 scaffolds totaling 833 Mb with 34,010 genes. A total of 2822 and 2034 expanded gene families were found in jackfruit and breadfruit, respectively, enriched in pathways including starch and sucrose metabolism, photosynthesis, and others. The copy number of several starch synthesis-related genes were found to be increased in jackfruit and breadfruit compared to closely-related species, and the tissue-specific expression might imply their sugar-rich and starch-rich characteristics. Overall, the publication of high-quality genomes for jackfruit and breadfruit provides information about their specific composition and the underlying genes involved in sugar and starch metabolism.

Abstract: The Atlantic herring is a model species for exploring the genetic basis for ecological adaptation, due to its huge population size and extremely low genetic differentiation at selectively neutral loci. However, such studies have so far been hampered because of a highly fragmented genome assembly. Here, we deliver a chromosome-level genome assembly based on a hybrid approach combining a de novo Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) assembly with Hi-C-supported scaffolding. The assembly comprises 26 autosomes with sizes ranging from 12.4 to 33.1 Mb and a total size, in chromosomes, of 726 Mb, which has been corroborated by a high-resolution linkage map. A comparison between the herring genome assembly with other high-quality assemblies from bony fishes revealed few inter-chromosomal but frequent intra-chromosomal rearrangements. The improved assembly facilitates analysis of previously intractable large-scale structural variation, allowing, for example, the detection of a 7.8-Mb inversion on Chromosome 12 underlying ecological adaptation. This supergene shows strong genetic differentiation between populations. The chromosome-based assembly also markedly improves the interpretation of previously detected signals of selection, allowing us to reveal hundreds of independent loci associated with ecological adaptation.

Abstract: Penicillium is an ascomycetous genus widely distributed in the natural environment and is one of the dominant fungi involved in the decomposition of mangroves, which can produce a variety of antitumor compounds and bioactive substances. However, in mangrove ecosystems there is no complete genome in this genus. In this study, we isolated a fungus strain named Penicillium variabile HXQ-H-1 from coast mangrove (Fujian Province, China). We generated a chromosome-level genome with total size of 33.32 Mb, scaffold N50 of 5.23 Mb and contig N50 of 96.74 kb. Additionally, we anchored about 95.91% assembly sequences into the longest seven scaffolds, and predicted 10,622 protein-coding genes, in which 99.66% could be annotated by eight protein databases. The secondary metabolites analysis reveals the strain has various gene clusters involving polyketide synthase (PKS), non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) and terpene synthase that may have a largely capacity of biotechnological potential. Comparison genome analysis between Penicillium variabile and Talaromyces islandicus reveals a small difference in the total number of genes, whereas HXQ-H-1 has a higher gene number with COG functional annotation. Evolutionary relationship of Penicillum based on genome-wide data was carried out for the first time, showing the strain HXQ-H-1 is closely related to Talaromyces islandicus. This genomic resource may provide a new resource for development of novel bioactive antibiotics, drug candidates and precursors in Penicillium variabile.

Abstract: Brassicales is a diverse angiosperm order with about 4700 recognized species. Here, we assembled and described the complete plastid genomes from four species of Brassicales: Capparis urophylla F.Chun (Capparaceae), Carica papaya L. (Caricaceae), Cleome rutidosperma DC. (Cleomaceae), and Moringa oleifera Lam. (Moringaceae), including two plastid genomes newly assembled for two families (Capparaceae and Moringaceae). The four plastid genomes are 159,680 base pairs on average in length and encode 78 protein-coding genes. The genomes each contain a typical structure of a large single-copy (LSC) region and a small single-copy (SSC) region separated by two inverted repeat (IR) regions. We performed the maximum-likelihood (ML) phylogenetic analysis using three different data sets of 66 protein-coding genes (ntAll, ntNo3rd and AA). Our phylogenetic results from different dataset are congruent, and are consistent with previous phylogenetic studies of Brassciales.

Abstract: Integrative analysis of multi-omics layers at single cell level is critical for accurate dissection of cell-to-cell variation within certain cell populations. Here we report scCAT-seq, a technique for simultaneously assaying chromatin accessibility and the transcriptome within the same single cell. We show that the combined single cell signatures enable accurate construction of regulatory relationships between cis-regulatory elements and the target genes at single-cell resolution, providing a new dimension of features that helps direct discovery of regulatory patterns specific to distinct cell identities. Moreover, we generate the first single cell integrated map of chromatin accessibility and transcriptome in early embryos and demonstrate the robustness of scCAT-seq in the precise dissection of master transcription factors in cells of distinct states. The ability to obtain these two layers of omics data will help provide more accurate definitions of "single cell state" and enable the deconvolution of regulatory heterogeneity from complex cell populations.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Genome sequencing has been widely used in plant research to construct reference genomes and provide evolutionary insights. However, few plant species have had their whole genome sequenced, thus restraining the utility of these data. We collected 1,093 samples of vascular plant species growing in the Ruili Botanical Garden, located in southwest China. Of these, we sequenced 761 samples and collected voucher specimens stored in the Herbarium of China National GeneBank. RESULTS: The 761 sequenced samples represented 689 vascular plant species from 137 families belonging to 49 orders. Of these, 257 samples were identified to the species level and 504 to the family level, using specimen and chloroplast sequences. In total, we generated 54 Tb of sequencing data, with an average sequencing depth of 60X per species, as estimated from genome sizes. A reference phylogeny was reconstructed with 78 chloroplast genes for molecular identification and other possible applications. CONCLUSIONS: The large dataset of vascular plant genomes generated in this study, which includes both high-depth whole-genome sequencing data and associated voucher specimens, is valuable for plant genome research and other applications. This project also provides insight into the feasibility and technical requirements for "planetary-scale" projects such as the 10,000 Plant Genomes Project and the Earth BioGenome Project.

Abstract: Selenoproteins that contain selenocysteine (Sec) are found in all kingdoms of life. Although they constitute a small proportion of the proteome, selenoproteins play essential roles in many organisms. In photosynthetic eukaryotes, selenoproteins have been found in algae but are missing in land plants (embryophytes). In this study, we explored the evolutionary dynamics of Sec incorporation by conveying a genomic search for the Sec machinery and selenoproteins across Archaeplastida. We identified a complete Sec machinery and variable sizes of selenoproteomes in the main algal lineages. However, the entire Sec machinery was missing in the Bangiophyceae-Florideophyceae clade (BV) of Rhodoplantae (red algae) and only partial machinery was found in three species of Archaeplastida, indicating parallel loss of Sec incorporation in different groups of algae. Further analysis of genome and transcriptome data suggests that all major lineages of streptophyte algae display a complete Sec machinery, although the number of selenoproteins is low in this group, especially in subaerial taxa. We conclude that selenoproteins tend to be lost in Archaeplastida upon adaptation to a subaerial or acidic environment. The high number of redox-active selenoproteins found in some bloom-forming marine microalgae may be related to defense against viral infections. Some of the selenoproteins in these organisms may have been gained by horizontal gene transfer from bacteria.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Mammalian commensal microbiota play important roles in the health of its host. In comparison to terrestrial mammals, commensal microbiota of marine mammals is mainly focused on the composition and function of skin and gut microbiota, with less attention paid to the health impact of bacteria and viruses. Previous studies on sperm whales (Physeter catodon) have affirmed their important phylogenetic position; however, studies on their commensal microbiota have not been published, due to difficulty in sample collection. METHODS: Here, we sequenced the metagenomes of blood, muscle and fecal samples from a stranded sperm whale using the BGISEQ-500 platform. We compared the diversity and abundance of microbiomes from three different tissues and tried to search pathogenic bacterial and virulence genes probably related to the health of the sperm whale. We also performed 16S rDNA sequencing of the fecal sample to compare to published gut metagenome data from other marine mammals. RESULTS: Our results demonstrated notable differences in species richness and abundance in the three samples. Extensive bacteria, including Enterococcus faecium, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus anginosus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Streptococcus suis, and five toxigenic Clostridium species usually associated with infection, were found in the three samples. We also found the taxa composition of sperm whale gut microbiota was similar to that of other whales, suggesting co-evolution with its host. This study is the first report of the sperm whale gut microbiome, and provides a foundation for the pathogen detection and health assessment of the sperm whale.

Abstract: The primary goal of cattle genomics is the identification of genome-wide polymorphism associated with economically important traits. The bovine genome sequencing project was completed in 2009. Since then, using massively parallel sequencing technologies, a large number of Bos taurus cattle breeds have been resequenced and scanned for genome-wide polymorphisms. As a result, a substantial number of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been discovered across European Bos taurus genomes, whereas extremely less number of SNPs are cataloged for Bos indicus breeds. In this study, we performed whole-genome resequencing, reference-based mapping, functional annotation and gene enrichment analysis of 20 sires representing eleven important Bos indicus (indicine) breeds of Pakistan. The breeds sequenced here include: Sahiwal, Red Sindhi, Tharparkar and Cholistani (tropically adapted dairy and dual purpose breeds), Achai, Bhagnari, Dajal and Lohani (high altitude adapted dual and drought purpose breeds); Dhanni, Hisar Haryana and Gabrali (dairy and light drought purpose breeds). A total of 17.4 billion QC passed reads were produced using BGISEQ-500 next generation sequencing platform to generate 9 to 27-fold genome coverage (average ~16x) for each of the 20 sequenced sires. A total of 67,303,469 SNPs were identified, of which 3,850,365 were found novel and 1,083,842 insertions-deletions (InDels) were detected across the whole sequenced genomes (491,247 novel). Comparative analysis using coding region SNPs revealed a close relationship between the best milking indicine breeds; Red Sindhi and Sahiwal. On the other hand, Bhagnari and Tharparkar being popular for their adaptation to dry and extremely hot climates were found to share the highest number of SNPs. Functional annotation identified a total of 3,194 high-impact (disruptive) SNPs and 745 disruptive InDels (in 275 genes) that may possibly affect economically important dairy and beef traits. Functional enrichment analysis was performed and revealed that high or moderate impact variants in wingless-related integration site (Wnt) and vascular smooth muscle contraction (VSMC) signaling pathways were significantly over-represented in tropically adapted heat tolerant Pakistani-indicine breeds. On the other hand, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) signaling pathways were found over-represented in highland adapted Pakistani-indicine breeds. Similarly, the ECM-receptor interaction and Jak-STAT signaling pathway were significantly enriched in dairy and beef purpose Pakistani-indicine cattle breeds. The Toll-like receptor signaling pathway was significantly enriched in most of the Pakistani-indicine cattle. Therefore, this study provides baseline data for further research to investigate the molecular mechanisms of major traits and to develop potential genomic markers associated with economically important breeding traits, particularly in indicine cattle.

Abstract: The African Orphan Crops Consortium (AOCC) successfully initiated the ambitious genome sequencing project of 101 African orphan crops/trees with 6 genomes sequenced, 6 near completion, and 20 currently in progress. Addressing stunting, malnutrition, and hidden hunger through nutritious, economic, and resilient agri-food system is one of the major agricultural challenges of this century. As sub-Saharan Africa harbors a large portion of the severely malnourished population, the African Orphan Crops Consortium (AOCC) was established in 2011 with an aim to reduce stunting and malnutrition by providing nutritional security through improving locally adapted nutritious, but neglected, under-researched or orphan African food crops. Foods from these indigenous or naturalized crops and trees are rich in minerals, vitamins, and antioxidant, and are an integral part of the dietary portfolio and cultural, social, and economic milieu of African farmers. Through stakeholder consultations supported by the African Union, 101 African orphan and under-researched crop species were prioritized to mainstream into African agri-food systems. The AOCC, through a network of international-regional-public-private partnerships and collaborations, is generating genomic resources of three types, i.e., reference genome sequence, transcriptome sequence, and re-sequencing 100 accessions/species, using next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology. Furthermore, the University of California Davis African Plant Breeding Academy under the AOCC banner is training 150 lead African scientists to breed high yielding, nutritious, and climate-resilient (biotic and abiotic stress tolerant) crop varieties that meet African farmer and consumer needs. To date, one or more forms of sequence data have been produced for 60 crops. Reference genome sequences for six species have already been published, 6 are almost near completion, and 19 are in progress.

Short Title: A chromosome‐level genome of black rockfish, Sebastes schlegelii, provides insights into the evolution of live birth
ISSN: 1755-098X
Abstract: The black rockfish (Sebastes schlegelii) is a teleost in which eggs are fertilized internally and retained in the maternal reproductive system, where they undergo development until live birth (viviparity). In the present study, we report a chromosome-level black rockfish genome assembly. High-throughput transcriptome analysis (RNA-seq and ATAC-seq) coupled with in situ hybridization (ISH) and immunofluorescence reveal several candidate genes for maternal preparation, sperm storage and release, and hatching. We propose that zona pellucida (ZP) proteins retain sperm at the oocyte envelope, while genes in two distinct astacin metalloproteinase subfamilies serve to release sperm from the ZP and free the embryo from chorion at prehatching stage. We present a model of black rockfish reproduction, and propose that the rockfish ovarian wall has a similar function to the uterus of mammals. Together, these genomic data reveal unprecedented insights into the evolution of an unusual teleost life history strategy, and provide a sound foundation for studying viviparity in nonmammalian vertebrates and an invaluable resource for rockfish ecological and evolutionary research.

Abstract: Objective The strong genetic contribution of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) region to rheumatoid arthritis (RA) has been generally attributed to human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DRB1. However, due to the high polymorphisms and linkage disequilibrium within MHC, it is difficult to define novel and/or independent genetic risks using conventional HLA genotyping or chip-based microarray technology. This study aimed to identify novel RA risk variants by performing deep sequencing for MHC.
Methods We first conducted target sequencing for the entire MHC region in 357 anticitrullinated protein antibodies (ACPA)-positive patients with RA and 1001 healthy controls, and then performed HLA typing in an independent case-control cohort consisting of 1415 samples for validation. All study subjects were Han Chinese. Genetic associations for RA susceptibility and severity were analysed. Comparative modelling was constructed to predict potential functions for the newly discovered RA association variants.
Results HLA-DQ alpha 1:160D conferred the strongest and independent susceptibility to ACPA-positive RA (p=6.16x10(-36), OR=2.29). DR beta 1:37N had an independent protective effect (p=5.81x10(-16), OR=0.49). As predicted by comparative modelling, the negatively charged DQ alpha 1:160D stabilises the dimer of dimers, thus may lead to an increased T cell activation. The negatively charged DR beta 1:37N encoding alleles preferentially bind with epitope P9 arginine, thus may result in a decreased RA susceptibility.
Conclusions We provide the first evidence that HLA-DQ alpha 1:160D, instead of HLA-DRB1*0405, is the strongest and independent genetic risk for ACPA-positive RA in Han Chinese. Our study also illustrates the value of deep sequencing for fine-mapping disease risk variants in the MHC region.

Abstract: Horseshoe crabs including Tachypleus tridentatus are a group of marine arthropods and living fossil species which have existed on the earth for similar to 500 million years. However, the genetic mechanisms underlying their unique adaptive ability are still unclear. Here, we assembled the first chromosome-level T. tridentatus genome, and proved that this genome is of high quality with contig N50 1.69 Mb. By comparison with other arthropods, some gene families of T. tridentatus experienced significant expansion, which are related to several signaling pathways, endonuclease activities, and metabolic processes. Based on the results of comparative analysis of genomics and 27 transcriptomes from nine tissues, we found that the expanded Dscam genes are located at key hub positions of immune network. Furthermore, the Dscam genes showed higher levels of expression in the yellow connective tissue (the birthplace of blood cells with strong differentiation capability) than the other eight tissues. Besides, the Dscam genes are positively correlated with the expression of the core immunity gene, clotting factor B, which is involved in the coagulation cascade reaction. The effective and unusual immune ability endowed by the expansion and expression of Dscam genes in the horseshoe crab may be a factor that makes the species have a strong environmental adaptability within similar to 500 million years. The high quality chromosome level genome of a horseshoe crab and unique genomic features reported in this study provide important data resources for future studies on the evolution of marine ecological systems.

Abstract: Ascochyta blight (AB) is one of the major biotic stresses known to limit the chickpea production worldwide. To dissect the complex mechanisms of AB resistance in chickpea, three approaches, namely, transcriptome, small RNA and degradome sequencing were used. The transcriptome sequencing of 20 samples including two resistant genotypes, two susceptible genotypes and one introgression line under control and stress conditions at two time points (3rd and 7th day post inoculation) identified a total of 6767 differentially expressed genes (DEGs). These DEGs were mainly related to pathogenesis-related proteins, disease resistance genes like NBS-LRR, cell wall biosynthesis and various secondary metabolite synthesis genes. The small RNA sequencing of the samples resulted in the identification of 651 miRNAs which included 478 known and 173 novel miRNAs. A total of 297 miRNAs were differentially expressed between different genotypes, conditions and time points. Using degradome sequencing and in silico approaches, 2131 targets were predicted for 629 miRNAs. The combined analysis of both small RNA and transcriptome datasets identified 12 miRNA-mRNA interaction pairs that exhibited contrasting expression in resistant and susceptible genotypes and also, a subset of genes that might be post-transcriptionally silenced during AB infection. The comprehensive integrated analysis in the study provides better insights into the transcriptome dynamics and regulatory network components associated with AB stress in chickpea and, also offers candidate genes for chickpea improvement.

Abstract: Moutai is a world-famous traditional Chinese liquor with complex taste and aroma, which are considered to be strongly influenced by the quality of fermentation starters (Daqu). However, the role of microbial communities in the starters has not been fully understood. In this study, we revealed the microbial composition of 185 Moutai starter samples, covering three different types of starters across immature and mature phases, and functional gene composition of mature starter microbiome. Our results showed that microbial composition patterns of immature starters varied, but they eventually were similar and steady when they became mature starters, after half-year storage and subsequent mixing. To help identify two types of immature starters, we selected seven operational taxonomic unit (OTU) markers by leave-one-out cross validation (LOOCV) and an OTU classified as Saccharopolyspora was the most decisive one. For mature starters, we identified a total of 16 core OTUs, one of which annotated as Bacillus was found positively associated with saccharifying power. We also identified the functional gene and microbial composition in starch and cellulose hydrolysis pathways. Microbes with higher abundances of alpha-glucosidase, alpha-amylase, and glucoamylase probably contributed to high saccharifying power. Overall, this study reveals the features of Moutai starter microbial communities in different phases and improves understanding of the relationships between microbiota and functional properties of the starters.

Short Title: The first chromosome‐level genome for a marine mammal as a resource to study ecology and evolution
ISSN: 1755-098X
Abstract: Marine mammals are important models for studying convergent evolution and aquatic adaption, and thus reference genomes of marine mammals can provide evolutionary insights. Here, we present the first chromosome-level marine mammal genome assembly based on the data generated by the BGISEQ-500 platform, for a stranded female sperm whale (Physeter macrocephalus). Using this reference genome, we performed chromosome evolution analysis of the sperm whale, including constructing ancestral chromosomes, identifying chromosome rearrangement events and comparing with cattle chromosomes, which provides a resource for exploring marine mammal adaptation and speciation. We detected a high proportion of long interspersed nuclear elements and expanded gene families, and contraction of major histocompatibility complex region genes which were specific to sperm whale. Using comparisons with sheep and cattle, we analysed positively selected genes to identify gene pathways that may be related to adaptation to the marine environment. Further, we identified possible convergent evolution in aquatic mammals by testing for positively selected genes across three orders of marine mammals. In addition, we used publicly available resequencing data to confirm a rapid decline in global population size in the Pliocene to Pleistocene transition. This study sheds light on the chromosome evolution and genetic mechanisms underpinning sperm whale adaptations, providing valuable resources for future comparative genomics.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The three epidemiologically important Opisthorchiidae liver flukes Opisthorchis felineus, O. viverrini, and Clonorchis sinensis, are believed to harbour similar potencies to provoke hepatobiliary diseases in their definitive hosts, although their populations have substantially different ecogeographical aspects including habitat, preferred hosts, population structure. Lack of O. felineus genomic data is an obstacle to the development of comparative molecular biological approaches necessary to obtain new knowledge about the biology of Opisthorchiidae trematodes, to identify essential pathways linked to parasite-host interaction, to predict genes that contribute to liver fluke pathogenesis and for the effective prevention and control of the disease. RESULTS: Here we present the first draft genome assembly of O. felineus and its gene repertoire accompanied by a comparative analysis with that of O. viverrini and Clonorchis sinensis. We observed both noticeably high heterozygosity of the sequenced individual and substantial genetic diversity in a pooled sample. This indicates that potency of O. felineus population for rapid adaptive response to control and preventive measures of opisthorchiasis is higher than in O. viverrini and C. sinensis. We also have found that all three species are characterized by more intensive involvement of trans-splicing in RNA processing compared to other trematodes. CONCLUSION: All revealed peculiarities of structural organization of genomes are of extreme importance for a proper description of genes and their products in these parasitic species. This should be taken into account both in academic and applied research of epidemiologically important liver flukes. Further comparative genomics studies of liver flukes and non-carcinogenic flatworms allow for generation of well-grounded hypotheses on the mechanisms underlying development of cholangiocarcinoma associated with opisthorchiasis and clonorchiasis as well as species-specific mechanisms of these diseases.

Abstract: Although geographic isolation is a leading driver of speciation, the tempo and pattern of divergence at the genomic level remain unclear. We examine genome-wide divergence of putatively single-copy orthologous genes (POGs) in 20 allopatric species/variety pairs from diverse angiosperm clades, with 16 pairs reflecting the classic eastern Asia-eastern North America floristic disjunction. In each pair, >90% of POGs are under purifying selection, and <10% are under positive selection. A set of POGs are under strong positive selection, 14 of which are shared by 10-15 pairs, and one shared by all pairs; 15 POGs are annotated to biological processes responding to various stimuli. The relative abundance of POGs under different selective forces exhibits a repeated pattern among pairs despite an ~10 million-year difference in divergence time. Species divergence times are positively correlated with abundance of POGs under moderate purifying selection, but negatively correlated with abundance of POGs under strong purifying selection.

Abstract: The transition to a terrestrial environment, termed terrestrialization, is generally regarded as a pivotal event in the evolution and diversification of the land plant flora that changed the surface of our planet. Through phylogenomic studies, a group of streptophyte algae, the Zygnematophyceae, have recently been recognized as the likely sister group to land plants (embryophytes). Here, we report genome sequences and analyses of two early diverging Zygnematophyceae (Spirogloea muscicola gen. nov. and Mesotaenium endlicherianum) that share the same subaerial/terrestrial habitat with the earliest-diverging embryophytes, the bryophytes. We provide evidence that genes (i.e., GRAS and PYR/PYURCAR) that increase resistance to biotic and abiotic stresses in land plants, in particular desiccation, originated or expanded in the common ancestor of Zygnematophyceae and embryophytes, and were gained by horizontal gene transfer (HGT) from soil bacteria. These two Zygnematophyceae genomes represent a cornerstone for future studies to understand the underlying molecular mechanism and process of plant terrestrialization.

Abstract: Background The Mongolian gerbil (Meriones unguiculatus) has historically been used as a model organism for the auditory and visual systems, stroke/ischemia, epilepsy and aging related research since 1935 when laboratory gerbils were separated from their wild counterparts. In this study we report genome sequencing, assembly, and annotation further supported by transcriptome sequencing and assembly from 27 different tissues samples. Results The genome was sequenced using Illumina HiSeq 2000 and after assembly resulted in a final genome size of 2.54 Gbp with contig and scaffold N50 values of 31.4 Kbp and 500.0 Kbp, respectively. Based on the k-mer estimated genome size of 2.48 Gbp, the assembly appears to be complete. The genome annotation was supported by transcriptome data that identified 31,769 (> 2000 bp) predicted protein-coding genes across 27 tissue samples. A BUSCO search of 3023 mammalian groups resulted in 86% of curated single copy orthologs present among predicted genes, indicating a high level of completeness of the genome. Conclusions We report the first de novo assembly of the Mongolian gerbil genome enhanced by assembly of transcriptome data from several tissues. Sequencing of this genome and transcriptome increases the utility of the gerbil as a model organism, opening the availability of now widely used genetic tools.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The expanding world population is expected to double the worldwide demand for food by 2050. Eighty-eight percent of countries currently face a serious burden of malnutrition, especially in Africa and south and southeast Asia. About 95% of the food energy needs of humans are fulfilled by just 30 species, of which wheat, maize, and rice provide the majority of calories. Therefore, to diversify and stabilize the global food supply, enhance agricultural productivity, and tackle malnutrition, greater use of neglected or underutilized local plants (so-called orphan crops, but also including a few plants of special significance to agriculture, agroforestry, and nutrition) could be a partial solution. RESULTS: Here, we present draft genome information for five agriculturally, biologically, medicinally, and economically important underutilized plants native to Africa: Vigna subterranea, Lablab purpureus, Faidherbia albida, Sclerocarya birrea, and Moringa oleifera. Assembled genomes range in size from 217 to 654 Mb. In V. subterranea, L. purpureus, F. albida, S. birrea, and M. oleifera, we have predicted 31,707, 20,946, 28,979, 18,937, and 18,451 protein-coding genes, respectively. By further analyzing the expansion and contraction of selected gene families, we have characterized root nodule symbiosis genes, transcription factors, and starch biosynthesis-related genes in these genomes. CONCLUSIONS: These genome data will be useful to identify and characterize agronomically important genes and understand their modes of action, enabling genomics-based, evolutionary studies, and breeding strategies to design faster, more focused, and predictable crop improvement programs.

Abstract: Tomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV) is a devastating disease to peanut growers in the South-eastern region of the United States. Newly released peanut cultivars in recent years are crucial as they have some levels of resistance to TSWV. One mapping population of recombinant inbred line (RIL) used in this study was derived from peanut lines of SunOleic 97R and NC94022. A whole genome re-sequencing approach was used to sequence these two parents and 140 RILs. A recombination bin-based genetic map was constructed, with 5,816 bins and 20 linkage groups covering a total length of 2004 cM. Using this map, we identified three QTLs which were colocalized on chromosome A01. One QTL had the largest effect of 36.51% to the phenotypic variation and encompassed 89.5 Kb genomic region. This genome region had a cluster of genes, which code for chitinases, strictosidine synthase-like, and NBS-LRR proteins. SNPs linked to this QTL were used to develop Kompetitive allele specific PCR (KASP) markers, and the validated KASP markers showed expected segregation of alleles coming from resistant and susceptible parents within the population. Therefore, this bin-map and QTL associated with TSWV resistance made it possible for functional gene mapping, map-based cloning, and marker-assisted breeding. This study identified the highest number of SNP makers and demonstrated recombination bin-based map for QTL identification in peanut. The chitinase gene clusters and NBS-LRR disease resistance genes in this region suggest the possible involvement in peanut resistance to TSWV.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Calamus simplicifolius and Daemonorops jenkinsiana are two representative rattans, the most significant material sources for the rattan industry. However, the lack of reference genome sequences is a major obstacle for basic and applied biology on rattan. FINDINGS: We produced two chromosome-level genome assemblies of C. simplicifolius and D. jenkinsiana using Illumina, Pacific Biosciences, and Hi-C sequencing data. A total of approximately 730 Gb and approximately 682 Gb of raw data covered the predicted genome lengths ( approximately 1.98 Gb of C. simplicifolius and approximately 1.61 Gb of D. jenkinsiana) to approximately 372 x and approximately 426 x read depths, respectively. The two de novo genome assemblies, approximately 1.94 Gb and approximately 1.58 Gb, were generated with scaffold N50s of approximately 160 Mb and approximately 119 Mb in C. simplicifolius and D. jenkinsiana, respectively. The C. simplicifolius and D. jenkinsiana genomes were predicted to harbor 51,235 and 53,342 intact protein-coding gene models, respectively. Benchmarking Universal Single-Copy Orthologs evaluation demonstrated that genome completeness reached 96.4% and 91.3% in the C. simplicifolius and D. jenkinsiana genomes, respectively. Genome evolution showed that four Arecaceae plants clustered together, and the divergence time between the two rattans was approximately 19.3 million years ago. Additionally, we identified 193 and 172 genes involved in the lignin biosynthesis pathway in the C. simplicifolius and D. jenkinsiana genomes, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: We present the first de novo assemblies of two rattan genomes (C. simplicifolius and D. jenkinsiana). These data will not only provide a fundamental resource for functional genomics, particularly in promoting germplasm utilization for breeding, but also serve as reference genomes for comparative studies between and among different species.

Abstract: Mei (Prunus mume) is an ornamental woody plant that has been domesticated in East Asia for thousands of years. High diversity in floral traits, along with its recent genome sequence, makes mei an ideal model system for studying the evolution of woody plants. Here, we investigate the genetic architecture of floral traits in mei and its domestication history by sampling and resequencing a total of 351 samples including 348 mei accessions and three other Prunus species at an average sequencing depth of 19.3x. Highly-admixed population structure and introgression from Prunus species are identified in mei accessions. Through a genome-wide association study (GWAS), we identify significant quantitative traits locus (QTLs) and genomic regions where several genes, such as MYB108, are positively associated with petal color, stigma color, calyx color, and bud color. Results from this study shed light on the genetic basis of domestication in flowering plants, particularly woody plants.

Abstract: Citrus is a globally important, perennial fruit crop whose rhizosphere microbiome is thought to play an important role in promoting citrus growth and health. Here, we report a comprehensive analysis of the structural and functional composition of the citrus rhizosphere microbiome. We use both amplicon and deep shotgun metagenomic sequencing of bulk soil and rhizosphere samples collected across distinct biogeographical regions from six continents. Predominant taxa include Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Acidobacteria and Bacteroidetes. The core citrus rhizosphere microbiome comprises Pseudomonas, Agrobacterium, Cupriavidus, Bradyrhizobium, Rhizobium, Mesorhizobium, Burkholderia, Cellvibrio, Sphingomonas, Variovorax and Paraburkholderia, some of which are potential plant beneficial microbes. We also identify over-represented microbial functional traits mediating plant-microbe and microbe-microbe interactions, nutrition acquisition and plant growth promotion in citrus rhizosphere. The results provide valuable information to guide microbial isolation and culturing and, potentially, to harness the power of the microbiome to improve plant production and health.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Japanese quail (Coturnix japonica), a recently domesticated poultry species, is important not only as an agricultural product, but also as a model bird species for genetic research. However, most of the biological questions concerning genomics, phylogenetics, and genetics of some important economic traits have not been answered. It is thus necessary to complete a high-quality genome sequence as well as a series of comparative genomics, evolution, and functional studies. RESULTS: Here, we present a quail genome assembly spanning 1.04 Gb with 86.63% of sequences anchored to 30 chromosomes (28 autosomes and 2 sex chromosomes Z/W). Our genomic data have resolved the long-term debate of phylogeny among Perdicinae (Japanese quail), Meleagridinae (turkey), and Phasianinae (chicken). Comparative genomics and functional genomic data found that four candidate genes involved in early maturation had experienced positive selection, and one of them encodes follicle stimulating hormone beta (FSHbeta), which is correlated with different FSHbeta levels in quail and chicken. We re-sequenced 31 quails (10 wild, 11 egg-type, and 10 meat-type) and identified 18 and 26 candidate selective sweep regions in the egg-type and meat-type lines, respectively. That only one of them is shared between egg-type and meat-type lines suggests that they were subject to an independent selection. We also detected a haplotype on chromosome Z, which was closely linked with maroon/yellow plumage in quail using population resequencing and a genome-wide association study. This haplotype block will be useful for quail breeding programs. CONCLUSIONS: This study provided a high-quality quail reference genome, identified quail-specific genes, and resolved quail phylogeny. We have identified genes related to quail early maturation and a marker for plumage color, which is significant for quail breeding. These results will facilitate biological discovery in quails and help us elucidate the evolutionary processes within the Phasianidae family.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The spotted sea bass (Lateolabrax maculatus) is a valuable commercial fish that is widely cultured in China. While analyses using molecular markers and population genetics have been conducted, genomic resources are lacking. FINDINGS: Here, we report a chromosome-scale assembly of the spotted sea bass genome by high-depth genome sequencing, assembly, and annotation. The genome scale was 0.67 Gb with contig and scaffold N50 length of 31 Kb and 1,040 Kb, respectively. Hi-C scaffolding of the genome resulted in 24 pseudochromosomes containing 77.68% of the total assembled sequences. A total of 132.38 Mb repeat sequences were detected, accounting for 20.73% of the assembled genome. A total of 22, 015 protein-coding genes were predicted, of which 96.52% were homologous to proteins in various databases. In addition, we constructed a phylogenetic tree using 1,586 single-copy gene families and identified 125 unique gene families in the spotted sea bass genome. CONCLUSIONS: We assembled a spotted sea bass genome that will be a valuable genomic resource to understanding the biology of the spotted sea bass and will also lead to the development of molecular breeding techniques to generate spotted sea bass with better economic traits.

Abstract: Extrachromosomal circular DNA (eccDNA) and ring chromosomes are genetic alterations found in humans with genetic disorders. However, there is a lack of genetic engineering tools to recapitulate and study the biogenesis of eccDNAs. Here, we created a dual-fluorescence biosensor cassette, which upon the delivery of pairs of CRISPR/Cas9 guide RNAs, CRISPR-C, allows us to study the biogenesis of a specific fluorophore expressing eccDNA in human cells. We show that CRISPR-C can generate functional eccDNA, using the novel eccDNA biosensor system. We further reveal that CRISPR-C also can generate eccDNAs from intergenic and genic loci in human embryonic kidney 293T cells and human mammary fibroblasts. EccDNAs mainly forms by end-joining mediated DNA-repair and we show that CRISPR-C is able to generate endogenous eccDNAs in sizes from a few hundred base pairs and ranging up to 207 kb. Even a 47.4 megabase-sized ring chromosome 18 can be created by CRISPR-C. Our study creates a new territory for CRISPR gene editing and highlights CRISPR-C as a useful tool for studying the cellular impact, persistence and function of eccDNAs.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Fusion of DNA methyltransferase domains to the nuclease-deficient clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR) associated protein 9 (dCas9) has been used for epigenome editing, but the specificities of these dCas9 methyltransferases have not been fully investigated. FINDINGS: We generated CRISPR-guided DNA methyltransferases by fusing the catalytic domain of DNMT3A or DNMT3B to the C terminus of the dCas9 protein from Streptococcus pyogenes and validated its on-target and global off-target characteristics. Using targeted quantitative bisulfite pyrosequencing, we prove that dCas9-BFP-DNMT3A and dCas9-BFP-DNMT3B can efficiently methylate the CpG dinucleotides flanking its target sites at different genomic loci (uPA and TGFBR3) in human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293T). Furthermore, we conducted whole genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) to address the specificity of our dCas9 methyltransferases. WGBS revealed that although dCas9-BFP-DNMT3A and dCas9-BFP-DNMT3B did not cause global methylation changes, a substantial number (more than 1000) of the off-target differentially methylated regions (DMRs) were identified. The off-target DMRs, which were hypermethylated in cells expressing dCas9 methyltransferase and guide RNAs, were predominantly found in promoter regions, 5΄ untranslated regions, CpG islands, and DNase I hypersensitivity sites, whereas unexpected hypomethylated off-target DMRs were significantly enriched in repeated sequences. Through chromatin immunoprecipitation with massive parallel DNA sequencing analysis, we further revealed that these off-target DMRs were weakly correlated with dCas9 off-target binding sites. Using quantitative polymerase chain reaction, RNA sequencing, and fluorescence reporter cells, we also found that dCas9-BFP-DNMT3A and dCas9-BFP-DNMT3B can mediate transient inhibition of gene expression, which might be caused by dCas9-mediated de novo DNA methylation as well as interference with transcription. CONCLUSION: Our results prove that dCas9 methyltransferases cause efficient RNA-guided methylation of specific endogenous CpGs. However, there is significant off-target methylation indicating that further improvements of the specificity of CRISPR-dCas9 based DNA methylation modifiers are required.

Abstract: Ferns are the closest sister group to all seed plants, yet little is known about their genomes other than that they are generally colossal. Here, we report on the genomes of Azolla filiculoides and Salvinia cucullata (Salviniales) and present evidence for episodic whole-genome duplication in ferns-one at the base of 'core leptosporangiates' and one specific to Azolla. One fern-specific gene that we identified, recently shown to confer high insect resistance, seems to have been derived from bacteria through horizontal gene transfer. Azolla coexists in a unique symbiosis with N(2)-fixing cyanobacteria, and we demonstrate a clear pattern of cospeciation between the two partners. Furthermore, the Azolla genome lacks genes that are common to arbuscular mycorrhizal and root nodule symbioses, and we identify several putative transporter genes specific to Azolla-cyanobacterial symbiosis. These genomic resources will help in exploring the biotechnological potential of Azolla and address fundamental questions in the evolution of plant life.

Abstract: The brown planthopper (BPH) and white-backed planthopper (WBPH) are the most destructive insect pests of rice, and they pose serious threats to rice production throughout Asia. Thus, there are urgent needs to identify resistance-conferring genes and to breed planthopper-resistant rice varieties. Here we report the map-based cloning and functional analysis of Bph6, a gene that confers resistance to planthoppers in rice. Bph6 encodes a previously uncharacterized protein that localizes to exocysts and interacts with the exocyst subunit OsEXO70E1. Bph6 expression increases exocytosis and participates in cell wall maintenance and reinforcement. A coordinated cytokinin, salicylic acid and jasmonic acid signaling pathway is activated in Bph6-carrying plants, which display broad resistance to all tested BPH biotypes and to WBPH without sacrificing yield, as these plants were found to maintain a high level of performance in a field that was heavily infested with BPH. Our results suggest that a superior resistance gene that evolved long ago in a region where planthoppers are found year round could be very valuable for controlling agricultural insect pests.

Abstract: The root nodule symbiosis of plants with nitrogen-fixing bacteria affects global nitrogen cycles and food production but is restricted to a subset of genera within a single clade of flowering plants. To explore the genetic basis for this scattered occurrence, we sequenced the genomes of 10 plant species covering the diversity of nodule morphotypes, bacterial symbionts, and infection strategies. In a genome-wide comparative analysis of a total of 37 plant species, we discovered signatures of multiple independent loss-of-function events in the indispensable symbiotic regulator NODULE INCEPTION in 10 of 13 genomes of nonnodulating species within this clade. The discovery that multiple independent losses shaped the present-day distribution of nitrogen-fixing root nodule symbiosis in plants reveals a phylogenetically wider distribution in evolutionary history and a so-far-underestimated selection pressure against this symbiosis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Siamese fighting fish Betta splendens are notorious for their aggressiveness and accordingly have been widely used to study aggression. However, the lack of a reference genome has, to date, limited the understanding of the genetic basis of aggression in this species. Here, we present the first reference genome assembly of the Siamese fighting fish. FINDINGS: Frist, we sequenced and de novo assembled a 465.24-Mb genome for the B. splendens variety Giant, with a weighted average (N50) scaffold size of 949.03 Kb and an N50 contig size of 19.01 Kb, covering 99.93% of the estimated genome size. To obtain a chromosome-level genome assembly, we constructed one Hi-C library and sequenced 75.24 Gb reads using the BGISEQ-500 platform. We anchored approximately 93% of the scaffold sequences into 21 chromosomes and evaluated the quality of our assembly using the high-contact frequency heat map and Benchmarking Universal Single-Copy Orthologs. We also performed comparative chromosome analyses between Oryzias latipes and B. splendens, revealing a chromosome conservation evolution in B. splendens. We predicted 23,981 genes assisted by RNA-sequencing data generated from brain, liver, muscle, and heart tissues of Giant and annotated 15% repetitive sequences in the genome. Additionally, we resequenced five other B. splendens varieties and detected approximately 3.4 M single-nucleotide variations and 27,305 insertions and deletions. CONCLUSIONS: We provide the first chromosome-level genome for the Siamese fighting fish. The genome will lay a valuable foundation for future research on aggression in B. splendens.

Abstract: Understanding plant evolution and diversity in a phylogenomic context is an enormous challenge due, in part, to limited availability of genome-scale data across phylodiverse species. The 10KP (10,000 Plants) Genome Sequencing Project will sequence and characterize representative genomes from every major clade of embryophytes, green algae, and protists (excluding fungi) within the next 5 years. By implementing and continuously improving leading-edge sequencing technologies and bioinformatics tools, 10KP will catalogue the genome content of plant and protist diversity and make these data freely available as an enduring foundation for future scientific discoveries and applications. 10KP is structured as an international consortium, open to the global community, including botanical gardens, plant research institutes, universities, and private industry. Our immediate goal is to establish a policy framework for this endeavor, the principles of which are outlined here.

Abstract: There have been intense debates over the geographic origin of African crops and agriculture. Here, we used whole-genome sequencing data to infer the domestication origin of pearl millet (Cenchrus americanus). Our results supported an origin in western Sahara, and we dated the onset of cultivated pearl millet expansion in Africa to 4,900 years ago. We provided evidence that wild-to-crop gene flow increased cultivated genetic diversity leading to diversity hotspots in western and eastern Sahel and adaptive introgression of 15 genomic regions. Our study reconciled genetic and archaeological data for one of the oldest African crops.

Whole Genome Sequencing
Abstract: The genetic variation in Northern Asian populations is currently undersampled. To address this, we generated a new genetic variation reference panel by whole-genome sequencing of 175 ethnic Mongolians, representing six tribes. The cataloged variation in the panel shows strong population stratification among these tribes, which correlates with the diverse demographic histories in the region. Incorporating our results with the 1000 Genomes Project panel identifies derived alleles shared between Finns and Mongolians/Siberians, suggesting that substantial gene flow between northern Eurasian populations has occurred in the past. Furthermore, we highlight that North, East, and Southeast Asian populations are more aligned with each other than these groups are with South Asian and Oceanian populations.

Abstract: Whole-genome resequencing (WGRS) of mapping populations has facilitated development of high-density genetic maps essential for fine mapping and candidate gene discovery for traits of interest in crop species. Leaf spots, including early leaf spot (ELS) and late leaf spot (LLS), and Tomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV) are devastating diseases in peanut causing significant yield loss. We generated WGRS data on a recombinant inbred line population, developed a SNP-based high-density genetic map, and conducted fine mapping, candidate gene discovery and marker validation for ELS, LLS and TSWV. The first sequence-based high-density map was constructed with 8869 SNPs assigned to 20 linkage groups, representing 20 chromosomes, for the 'T' population (Tifrunner x GT-C20) with a map length of 3120 cM and an average distance of 1.45 cM. The quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis using high-density genetic map and multiple season phenotyping data identified 35 main-effect QTLs with phenotypic variation explained (PVE) from 6.32% to 47.63%. Among major-effect QTLs mapped, there were two QTLs for ELS on B05 with 47.42% PVE and B03 with 47.38% PVE, two QTLs for LLS on A05 with 47.63% and B03 with 34.03% PVE and one QTL for TSWV on B09 with 40.71% PVE. The epistasis and environment interaction analyses identified significant environmental effects on these traits. The identified QTL regions had disease resistance genes including R-genes and transcription factors. KASP markers were developed for major QTLs and validated in the population and are ready for further deployment in genomics-assisted breeding in peanut.

Abstract: Bamboo and rattan are widely grown for manufacturing, horticulture, and agroforestry. Bamboo and rattan production might help reduce poverty, boost economic growth, mitigate climate change, and protect the natural environment. Despite progress in research, sufficient molecular and genomic resources to study these species are lacking. We launched the Genome Atlas of Bamboo and Rattan (GABR) project, a comprehensive, coordinated international effort to accelerate understanding of bamboo and rattan genetics through genome analysis. GABR includes 2 core subprojects: Bamboo-T1K (Transcriptomes of 1000 Bamboos) and Rattan-G5 (Genomes of 5 Rattans), and several other subprojects. Here we describe the organization, directions, and status of GABR.

Abstract: The truncated mutant form of the charged multivesicular body protein 2B (CHMP2B) is causative for frontotemporal dementia linked to chromosome 3 (FTD3). CHMP2B is a constituent of the endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) and, when mutated, disrupts endosome-to-lysosome trafficking and substrate degradation. To understand the underlying molecular pathology, FTD3 patient induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) were differentiated into forebrain-type cortical neurons. FTD3 neurons exhibited abnormal endosomes, as previously shown in patients. Moreover, mitochondria of FTD3 neurons displayed defective cristae formation, accompanied by deficiencies in mitochondrial respiration and increased levels of reactive oxygen. In addition, we provide evidence for perturbed iron homeostasis, presenting an in vitro patient-specific model to study the effects of iron accumulation in neurodegenerative diseases. All phenotypes observed in FTD3 neurons were rescued in CRISPR/Cas9-edited isogenic controls. These findings illustrate the relevance of our patient-specific in vitro models and open up possibilities for drug target development.

Abstract: The pattern and rate of genome evolution have profound consequences in organismal evolution. Whole-genome duplication (WGD), or polyploidy, has been recognized as an important evolutionary mechanism of plant diversification. However, in non-model plants the molecular signals of genome duplications have remained largely unexplored. High-throughput transcriptome data from next-generation sequencing have set the stage for novel investigations of genome evolution using new bioinformatic and methodological tools in a phylogenetic framework. Here we compare ten de novo-assembled transcriptomes representing the major lineages of the angiosperm genus Cornus (dogwood) and relevant outgroups using a customized pipeline for analyses. Using three distinct approaches, molecular dating of orthologous genes, analyses of the distribution of synonymous substitutions between paralogous genes, and examination of substitution rates through time, we detected a shared WGD event in the late Cretaceous across all taxa sampled. The inferred doubling event coincides temporally with the paleoclimatic changes associated with the initial divergence of the genus into three major lineages. Analyses also showed an acceleration of rates of molecular evolution after WGD. The highest rates of molecular evolution were observed in the transcriptome of the herbaceous lineage, C. canadensis, a species commonly found at higher latitudes, including the Arctic. Our study demonstrates the value of transcriptome data for understanding genome evolution in closely related species. The results suggest dramatic increase in sea surface temperature in the late Cretaceous may have contributed to the evolution and diversification of flowering plants.

Abstract: Enterovirus 96 (EV-96) is a recently described member of the species Enterovirus C and is associated with paralysis and myelitis. In this study, using metagenomic sequencing, we identified a new enterovirus 96 strain (EV-96-SZ/GD/CHN/2014) as the sole pathogen causing hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD). A genomic comparison showed that EV-96-SZ/GD/CHN/2014 is most similar to the EV-96-05517 strain (85% identity), which has also been detected in Guangdong Province. This is the first time that metagenomic sequencing has been used to identify an EV-96 strain shown to be associated with HFMD.

Abstract: With the advancement of second generation sequencing techniques, our ability to detect and quantify RNA editing on a global scale has been vastly improved. As a result, RNA editing is now being studied under a growing number of biological conditions so that its biochemical mechanisms and functional roles can be further understood. However, a major barrier that prevents RNA editing from being a routine RNA-seq analysis, similar to gene expression and splicing analysis, for example, is the lack of user-friendly and effective computational tools. Based on years of experience of analyzing RNA editing using diverse RNA-seq datasets, we have developed a software tool, RED-ML: RNA Editing Detection based on Machine learning (pronounced as "red ML"). The input to RED-ML can be as simple as a single BAM file, while it can also take advantage of matched genomic variant information when available. The output not only contains detected RNA editing sites, but also a confidence score to facilitate downstream filtering. We have carefully designed validation experiments and performed extensive comparison and analysis to show the efficiency and effectiveness of RED-ML under different conditions, and it can accurately detect novel RNA editing sites without relying on curated RNA editing databases. We have also made this tool freely available via GitHub <https://github.com/BGIRED/RED-ML>. We have developed a highly accurate, speedy and general-purpose tool for RNA editing detection using RNA-seq data. With the availability of RED-ML, it is now possible to conveniently make RNA editing a routine analysis of RNA-seq. We believe this can greatly benefit the RNA editing research community and has profound impact to accelerate our understanding of this intriguing posttranscriptional modification process.

Abstract: Pearl millet [Cenchrus americanus (L.) Morrone] is a staple food for more than 90 million farmers in arid and semi-arid regions of sub-Saharan Africa, India and South Asia. We report the approximately 1.79 Gb draft whole genome sequence of reference genotype Tift 23D(2)B(1)-P1-P5, which contains an estimated 38,579 genes. We highlight the substantial enrichment for wax biosynthesis genes, which may contribute to heat and drought tolerance in this crop. We resequenced and analyzed 994 pearl millet lines, enabling insights into population structure, genetic diversity and domestication. We use these resequencing data to establish marker trait associations for genomic selection, to define heterotic pools, and to predict hybrid performance. We believe that these resources should empower researchers and breeders to improve this important staple crop.

Short Title: The high‐quality genome of Brassica napus cultivar ‘ZS11’reveals the introgression history in semi‐winter morphotype
ISSN: 1365-313X
Abstract: Allotetraploid oilseed rape (Brassica napus L.) is an agriculturally important crop. Cultivation and breeding of B. napus by humans has resulted in numerous genetically diverse morphotypes with optimized agronomic traits and ecophysiological adaptation. To further understand the genetic basis of diversification and adaptation, we report a draft genome of an Asian semi-winter oilseed rape cultivar ‘ZS11’ and its comprehensive genomic comparison with the genomes of the winter-type cultivar ‘Darmor-bzh’ as well as two progenitors. The integrated BAC-to-BAC and whole-genome shotgun sequencing strategies were effective in the assembly of repetitive regions (especially young long terminal repeats) and resulted in a high-quality genome assembly of B. napus ‘ZS11’. Within a short evolutionary period (~6700 years ago), semi-winter-type ‘ZS11’ and the winter-type ‘Darmor-bzh’ maintained highly genomic collinearity. Even so, certain genetic differences were also detected in two morphotypes. Relative to ‘Darmor-bzh’, both two subgenomes of ‘ZS11’ are closely related to its progenitors, and the ‘ZS11’ genome harbored several specific segmental homoeologous exchanges (HEs). Furthermore, the semi-winter-type ‘ZS11’ underwent potential genomic introgressions with B. rapa (Ar). Some of these genetic differences were associated with key agronomic traits. A key gene of A03.FLC3 regulating vernalization-responsive flowering time in ‘ZS11’ was first experienced HE, and then underwent genomic introgression event with Ar, which potentially has led to genetic differences in controlling vernalization in the semi-winter types. Our observations improved our understanding of the genetic diversity of different B. napus morphotypes and the cultivation history of semi-winter oilseed rape in Asia.

Abstract: Gene retroposition is an important mechanism of genome evolution but the role it plays in dinoflagellates, a critical player in marine ecosystems, is not known. Until recently, when the genomes of two coral-symbiotic dinoflagellate genomes, Symbiodinium kawagutii and S. minutum, were released, it has not been possible to systematically study these retrogenes. Here we examine the abundant retrogenes ( approximately 23% of the total genes) in these species. The hallmark of retrogenes in the genome is the presence of DCCGTAGCCATTTTGGCTCAAG, a spliced leader (DinoSL) constitutively trans-spliced to the 5'-end of all nucleus-encoded mRNAs. Although the retrogenes have often lost part of the 22-nt DinoSL, the putative promoter motif from the DinoSL, TTT(T/G), is consistently retained in the upstream region of these genes, providing an explanation for the high survival rate of retrogenes in dinoflagellates. Our analysis of DinoSL sequence divergence revealed two major bursts of retroposition in the evolutionary history of Symbiodinium, occurring at approximately 60 and approximately 6 Ma. Reconstruction of the evolutionary trajectory of the Symbiodinium genomes mapped these 2 times to the origin and rapid radiation of this dinoflagellate lineage, respectively. GO analysis revealed differential functional enrichment of the retrogenes between the two episodes, with a broad impact on transport in the first bout and more localized influence on symbiosis-related processes such as cell adhesion in the second bout. This study provides the first evidence of large-scale retroposition as a major mechanism of genome evolution for any organism and sheds light on evolution of coral symbiosis.

Abstract: Compared with the commercially available single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) chip based on the Bead Chip technology, the solution hybrid selection (SHS)-based target enrichment SNP chip is not only design-flexible, but also cost-effective for genotype sequencing. In this study, we propose to design an animal SNP chip using the SHS-based target enrichment strategy for the first time. As an update to the international collaboration on goat research, a 66 K SNP chip for cashmere goat was created from the whole-genome sequencing data of 73 individuals. Verification of this 66 K SNP chip with the whole-genome sequencing data of 436 cashmere goats showed that the SNP call rates was between 95.3% and 99.8%. The average sequencing depth for target SNPs were 40X. The capture regions were shown to be 200 bp that flank target SNPs. This chip was further tested in a genome-wide association analysis of cashmere fineness (fiber diameter). Several top hit loci were found marginally associated with signaling pathways involved in hair growth. These results demonstrate that the 66 K SNP chip is a useful tool in the genomic analyses of cashmere goats. The successful chip design shows that the SHS-based target enrichment strategy could be applied to SNP chip design in other species.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) followed by database search is a main approach to identify peptides/proteins in proteomic studies. A lot of effort has been devoted to improve the identification accuracy and sensitivity for peptides/proteins, such as developing advanced algorithms and expanding protein databases. RESULTS: Herein, we described a new strategy for enhancing the sensitivity of protein/peptide identification through combination of mRNA and peptide abundance in Percolator. In our strategy, a new workflow for peptide identification is established on the basis of the abundance of transcripts and potential novel transcripts derived from RNA-Seq and abundance of peptides towards the same life species. We demonstrate the utility of this strategy by two MS/MS datasets and the results indicate that about 5% ~ 8% improvement of peptide identification can be achieved with 1% FDR in peptide level by integrating the peptide abundance, the transcript abundance and potential novel transcripts from RNA-Seq data. Meanwhile, 181 and 154 novel peptides were identified in the two datasets, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: We have demonstrated that this strategy could enable improvement of peptide/protein identification and discovery of novel peptides, as compared with the traditional search methods.

Abstract: Next-generation sequencing provides a high-resolution insight into human genetic information. However, the focus of previous studies has primarily been on low-coverage data due to the high cost of sequencing. Although the 1000 Genomes Project and the Haplotype Reference Consortium have both provided powerful reference panels for imputation, low-frequency and novel variants remain difficult to discover and call with accuracy on the basis of low-coverage data. Deep sequencing provides an optimal solution for the problem of these low-frequency and novel variants. Although whole-exome sequencing is also a viable choice for exome regions, it cannot account for noncoding regions, sometimes resulting in the absence of important, causal variants. For Han Chinese populations, the majority of variants have been discovered based upon low-coverage data from the 1000 Genomes Project. However, high-coverage, whole-genome sequencing data are limited for any population, and a large amount of low-frequency, population-specific variants remain uncharacterized. We have performed whole-genome sequencing at a high depth ( approximately x80) of 90 unrelated individuals of Chinese ancestry, collected from the 1000 Genomes Project samples, including 45 Northern Han Chinese and 45 Southern Han Chinese samples. Eighty-three of these 90 have been sequenced by the 1000 Genomes Project. We have identified 12 568 804 single nucleotide polymorphisms, 2 074 210 short InDels, and 26 142 structural variations from these 90 samples. Compared to the Han Chinese data from the 1000 Genomes Project, we have found 7 000 629 novel variants with low frequency (defined as minor allele frequency < 5%), including 5 813 503 single nucleotide polymorphisms, 1 169 199 InDels, and 17 927 structural variants. Using deep sequencing data, we have built a greatly expanded spectrum of genetic variation for the Han Chinese genome. Compared to the 1000 Genomes Project, these Han Chinese deep sequencing data enhance the characterization of a large number of low-frequency, novel variants. This will be a valuable resource for promoting Chinese genetics research and medical development. Additionally, it will provide a valuable supplement to the 1000 Genomes Project, as well as to other human genome projects.

Abstract: The root microbes play pivotal roles in plant productivity, nutrient uptakes, and disease resistance. The root microbial community structure has been extensively investigated by 16S/18S/ITS amplicons and metagenomic sequencing in crops and model plants. However, the functional associations between root microbes and host plant growth are poorly understood. This work investigates the root bacterial community of foxtail millet (Setaria italica) and its potential effects on host plant productivity. We determined the bacterial composition of 2882 samples from foxtail millet rhizoplane, rhizosphere and corresponding bulk soils from 2 well-separated geographic locations by 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. We identified 16 109 operational taxonomic units (OTUs), and defined 187 OTUs as shared rhizoplane core OTUs. The beta-diversity analysis revealed that microhabitat was the major factor shaping foxtail millet root bacterial community, followed by geographic locations. Large-scale association analysis identified the potential beneficial bacteria correlated with plant high productivity. Besides, the functional prediction revealed specific pathways enriched in foxtail millet rhizoplane bacterial community. We systematically described the root bacterial community structure of foxtail millet and found its core rhizoplane bacterial members. Our results demonstrated that host plants enrich specific bacteria and functions in the rhizoplane. The potentially beneficial bacteria may serve as a valuable knowledge foundation for bio-fertilizer development in agriculture.

Abstract: The gut microbiota has been linked to cardiovascular diseases. However, the composition and functional capacity of the gut microbiome in relation to cardiovascular diseases have not been systematically examined. Here, we perform a metagenome-wide association study on stools from 218 individuals with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ACVD) and 187 healthy controls. The ACVD gut microbiome deviates from the healthy status by increased abundance of Enterobacteriaceae and Streptococcus spp. and, functionally, in the potential for metabolism or transport of several molecules important for cardiovascular health. Although drug treatment represents a confounding factor, ACVD status, and not current drug use, is the major distinguishing feature in this cohort. We identify common themes by comparison with gut microbiome data associated with other cardiometabolic diseases (obesity and type 2 diabetes), with liver cirrhosis, and rheumatoid arthritis. Our data represent a comprehensive resource for further investigations on the role of the gut microbiome in promoting or preventing ACVD as well as other related diseases.The gut microbiota may play a role in cardiovascular diseases. Here, the authors perform a metagenome-wide association study on stools from individuals with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and healthy controls, identifying microbial strains and functions associated with the disease.

Abstract: BGISEQ-500 is a new desktop sequencer developed by BGI. Using DNA nanoball and combinational probe anchor synthesis developed from Complete Genomics sequencing technologies, it generates short reads at a large scale. Here, we present the first human whole-genome sequencing dataset of BGISEQ-500. The dataset was generated by sequencing the widely used cell line HG001 (NA12878) in two sequencing runs of paired-end 50 bp (PE50) and two sequencing runs of paired-end 100 bp (PE100). We also include examples of the raw images from the sequencer for reference. Finally, we identified variations using this dataset, estimated the accuracy of the variations, and compared to that of the variations identified from similar amounts of publicly available HiSeq2500 data. We found similar single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) detection accuracy for the BGISEQ-500 PE100 data (false positive rate [FPR] = 0.00020%, sensitivity = 96.20%) compared to the PE150 HiSeq2500 data (FPR = 0.00017%, sensitivity = 96.60%) better SNP detection accuracy than the PE50 data (FPR = 0.0006%, sensitivity = 94.15%). But for insertions and deletions (indels), we found lower accuracy for BGISEQ-500 data (FPR = 0.00069% and 0.00067% for PE100 and PE50 respectively, sensitivity = 88.52% and 70.93%) than the HiSeq2500 data (FPR = 0.00032%, sensitivity = 96.28%). Our dataset can serve as the reference dataset, providing basic information not just for future development, but also for all research and applications based on the new sequencing platform.

Abstract: The inflammatory intestinal disorder Crohn's disease (CD) has become a health challenge worldwide. The gut microbiota closely interacts with the host immune system, but its functional impact in CD is unclear. Except for studies on a small number of CD patients, analyses of the gut microbiota in CD have used 16S rDNA amplicon sequencing. Here we employed metagenomic shotgun sequencing to provide a detailed characterization of the compositional and functional features of the CD microbiota, comprising also unannotated bacteria, and investigated its modulation by exclusive enteral nutrition. Based on signature taxa, CD microbiotas clustered into 2 distinct metacommunities, indicating individual variability in CD microbiome structure. Metacommunity-specific functional shifts in CD showed enrichment in producers of the pro-inflammatory hexa-acylated lipopolysaccharide variant and a reduction in the potential to synthesize short-chain fatty acids. Disruption of ecological networks was evident in CD, coupled with reduction in growth rates of many bacterial species. Short-term exclusive enteral nutrition elicited limited impact on the overall composition of the CD microbiota, although functional changes occurred following treatment. The microbiotas in CD patients can be stratified into 2 distinct metacommunities, with the most severely perturbed metacommunity exhibiting functional potentials that deviate markedly from that of the healthy individuals, with possible implication in relation to CD pathogenesis.

Abstract: Rhodiola crenulata, a well-known medicinal Tibetan herb, is mainly grown in high-altitude regions of the Tibet, Yunnan, and Sichuan provinces in China. In the past few years, increasing numbers of studies have been published on the potential pharmacological activities of R. crenulata, strengthening our understanding into its putitive active ingredient composition, pharmacological activity, and mechanism of action. These findings also provide strong evidence supporting the important medicinal and economical value of R. crenulata. Consequently, some Rhodiola species are becoming endangered because of overexploitation and environmental destruction. However, little is known about the genetic and genomic information of any Rhodiola species. Here we report the first draft assembly ofthe R. crenulata genome, which was 344.5 Mb (25.7 Mb Ns), accounting for 82% of the estimated genome size, with a scaffold N50 length of 144.7 kb and a contig N50 length of 25.4 kb. The R. crenulata genome is not only highly heterozygous but also highly repetitive, with ratios of 1.12% and 66.15%, respectively, based on the k-mer analysis. Furthermore, 226.6 Mb of transposable elements were detected, of which 77.03% were long terminal repeats. In total, 31 517 protein-coding genes were identified, capturing 86.72% of expected plant genes in BUSCO. Additionally, 79.73% of protein-coding genes were functionally annotated. R. crenulata is an important medicinal plant and also a potentially interesting model species for studying the adaptability of Rhodiola species to extreme environments. The genomic sequences of R. crenulata will be useful for understanding the evolutionary mechanism of the stress resistance gene and the biosynthesis pathways of the different medicinal ingredients, for example, salidroside in R. crenulata.

Abstract: Background: Nacre, the iridescent material found in pearls and shells of molluscs, is formed through an extraordinary process of matrix-assisted biomineralization. Despite recent advances, many aspects of the biomineralization process and its evolutionary origin remain unknown. The pearl oyster Pinctada fucata martensii is a well-known master of biomineralization, but the molecular mechanisms that underlie its production of shells and pearls are not fully understood.
Results: We sequenced the highly polymorphic genome of the pearl oyster and conducted multi-omic and biochemical studies to probe nacre formation. We identified a large set of novel proteins participating in matrix-framework formation, many in expanded families, including components similar to that found in vertebrate bones such as collagen-related VWA-containing proteins (VWAP), chondroitin sulfotransferases and regulatory elements.
Conclusions: Considering that there are only collagen-based matrices in vertebrate bones and chitin-based matrices in most invertebrate skeletons, the presence of both chitin and elements of collagen-based matrices in nacre suggests that elements of chitin-and collagen-based matrices have deep roots and might be part of an ancient biomineralizing matrix. Our results expand the current shell matrix-framework model and provide new insights into the evolution of diverse biomineralization systems.

Abstract: Spermatogenic lineage has been directly generated in spermatogonial stem cell (SSC) conditions from human pluripotent stem cells (PSCs). However, it remains unknown whether mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) can directly differentiate into advanced male germ cell lineage in the same conditions. Here, we showed rather low efficiency of germ-like cell generation from mouse ESCs in SSC conditions. Interestingly, addition of retinoic acid (RA) into SSC conditions enabled efficient differentiation of mouse ESCs into germ-like cells, as shown by the activation of spermatogenesis-associated genes such as Mvh, Dazl, Prdm14, Stella, Scp1, Scp3, Stra8 and Rec8 In contrast, for cells cultured in control medium, the activation of the above genes barely occurred. In addition, RA with SSC conditions yielded colonies of Acrosin-expressing cells and the positive ratio reached a peak at day 6. Our work thus establishes a simple and cost-efficient approach for male germ like cell differentiation from mouse PSCs and may propose a useful strategy for studying spermatogenesis in vitro.

Abstract: The pig is a major species for livestock production and is also extensively used as the preferred model species for analyses of a wide range of human physiological functions and diseases(1). The importance of the gut microbiota in complementing the physiology and genome of the host is now well recognized(2). Knowledge of the functional interplay between the gut microbiota and host physiology in humans has been advanced by the human gut reference catalogue(3,4). Thus, establishment of a comprehensive pig gut microbiome gene reference catalogue constitutes a logical continuation of the recently published pig genome(5). By deep metagenome sequencing of faecal DNA from 287 pigs, we identified 7.7 million non-redundant genes representing 719 metagenomic species. Of the functional pathways found in the human catalogue, 96% are present in the pig catalogue, supporting the potential use of pigs for biomedical research. We show that sex, age and host genetics are likely to influence the pig gut microbiome. Analysis of the prevalence of antibiotic resistance genes demonstrated the effect of eliminating antibiotics from animal diets and thereby reducing the risk of spreading antibiotic resistance associated with farming systems.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Peptide identification based upon mass spectrometry (MS) is generally achieved by comparison of the experimental mass spectra with the theoretically digested peptides derived from a reference protein database. Obviously, this strategy could not identify peptide and protein sequences that are absent from a reference database. A customized protein database on the basis of RNA-Seq data is thus proposed to assist with and improve the identification of novel peptides. Correspondingly, development of a comprehensive pipeline, which provides an end-to-end solution for novel peptide detection with the customized protein database, is necessary. RESULTS: A pipeline with an R package, assigned as a PGA utility, was developed that enables automated treatment to the tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) data acquired from different MS platforms and construction of customized protein databases based on RNA-Seq data with or without a reference genome guide. Hence, PGA can identify novel peptides and generate an HTML-based report with a visualized interface. On the basis of a published dataset, PGA was employed to identify peptides, resulting in 636 novel peptides, including 510 single amino acid polymorphism (SAP) peptides, 2 INDEL peptides, 49 splice junction peptides, and 75 novel transcript-derived peptides. The software is freely available from http://bioconductor.org/packages/PGA/ , and the example reports are available at http://wenbostar.github.io/PGA/ . CONCLUSIONS: The pipeline of PGA, aimed at being platform-independent and easy-to-use, was successfully developed and shown to be capable of identifying novel peptides by searching the customized protein database derived from RNA-Seq data.

Abstract: Cultivated soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] is a primary source of vegetable oil and protein. We report a landscape analysis of genome-wide genetic variation and an association study of major domestication and agronomic traits in soybean. A total of 106 soybean genomes representing wild, landraces, and elite lines were re-sequenced at an average of 17x depth with a 97.5% coverage. Over 10 million high-quality SNPs were discovered, and 35.34% of these have not been previously reported. Additionally, 159 putative domestication sweeps were identified, which includes 54.34 Mbp (4.9%) and 4,414 genes; 146 regions were involved in artificial selection during domestication. A genome-wide association study of major traits including oil and protein content, salinity, and domestication traits resulted in the discovery of novel alleles. Genomic information from this study provides a valuable resource for understanding soybean genome structure and evolution, and can also facilitate trait dissection leading to sequencing-based molecular breeding.

Abstract: In order to understand the impact of breeding on genetic diversity and gain insights into temporal trends in diversity in chickpea, a set of 100 chickpea varieties released in 14 countries between 1948 and 2012 were re-sequenced. For analysis, the re-sequencing data for 29 varieties available from an earlier study was also included. Copy number variations and presence absence variations identified in the present study have potential to drive phenotypic variations for trait improvement. Re-sequencing of a large number of varieties has provided opportunities to inspect the genetic and genomic changes reflecting the history of breeding, which we consider as breeding signatures and the selected loci may provide targets for crop improvement. Our study also reports enhanced diversity in both desi and kabuli varieties as a result of recent chickpea breeding efforts. The current study will aid the explicit efforts to breed for local adaptation in the context of anticipated climate changes.

Abstract: Ecological adaptation is of major relevance to speciation and sustainable population management, but the underlying genetic factors are typically hard to study in natural populations due to genetic differentiation caused by natural selection being confounded with genetic drift in subdivided populations. Here, we use whole genome population sequencing of Atlantic and Baltic herring to reveal the underlying genetic architecture at an unprecedented detailed resolution for both adaptation to a new niche environment and timing of reproduction. We identify almost 500 independent loci associated with a recent niche expansion from marine (Atlantic Ocean) to brackish waters (Baltic Sea), and more than 100 independent loci showing genetic differentiation between spring- and autumn-spawning populations irrespective of geographic origin. Our results show that both coding and non-coding changes contribute to adaptation. Haplotype blocks, often spanning multiple genes and maintained by selection, are associated with genetic differentiation.

Abstract: The ruff is a Palearctic wader with a spectacular lekking behavior where highly ornamented males compete for females. This bird has one of the most remarkable mating systems in the animal kingdom, comprising three different male morphs (independents, satellites and faeders) that differ in behavior, plumage color and body size. Remarkably, the satellite and faeder morphs are controlled by dominant alleles. Here we have used whole-genome sequencing and resolved the enigma of how such complex phenotypic differences can have a simple genetic basis. The Satellite and Faeder alleles are both associated with a 4.5-Mb inversion that occurred about 3.8 million years ago. We propose an evolutionary scenario where the Satellite chromosome arose by a rare recombination event about 500,000 years ago. The ruff mating system is the result of an evolutionary process in which multiple genetic changes contributing to phenotypic differences between morphs have accumulated within the inverted region.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Ginkgo biloba L. (Ginkgoaceae) is one of the most distinctive plants. It possesses a suite of fascinating characteristics including a large genome, outstanding resistance/tolerance to abiotic and biotic stresses, and dioecious reproduction, making it an ideal model species for biological studies. However, the lack of a high-quality genome sequence has been an impediment to our understanding of its biology and evolution. FINDINGS: The 10.61 Gb genome sequence containing 41,840 annotated genes was assembled in the present study. Repetitive sequences account for 76.58% of the assembled sequence, and long terminal repeat retrotransposons (LTR-RTs) are particularly prevalent. The diversity and abundance of LTR-RTs is due to their gradual accumulation and a remarkable amplification between 16 and 24 million years ago, and they contribute to the long introns and large genome. Whole genome duplication (WGD) may have occurred twice, with an ancient WGD consistent with that shown to occur in other seed plants, and a more recent event specific to ginkgo. Abundant gene clusters from tandem duplication were also evident, and enrichment of expanded gene families indicates a remarkable array of chemical and antibacterial defense pathways. CONCLUSIONS: The ginkgo genome consists mainly of LTR-RTs resulting from ancient gradual accumulation and two WGD events. The multiple defense mechanisms underlying the characteristic resilience of ginkgo are fostered by a remarkable enrichment in ancient duplicated and ginkgo-specific gene clusters. The present study sheds light on sequencing large genomes, and opens an avenue for further genetic and evolutionary research.

Abstract: The pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) proteins form one of the largest protein families in land plants. They are characterised by tandem 30-40 amino acid motifs that form an extended binding surface capable of sequence-specific recognition of RNA strands. Almost all of them are post-translationally targeted to plastids and mitochondria, where they play important roles in post-transcriptional processes including splicing, RNA editing and the initiation of translation. A code describing how PPR proteins recognise their RNA targets promises to accelerate research on these proteins, but making use of this code requires accurate definition and annotation of all of the various nucleotide-binding motifs in each protein. We have used a structural modelling approach to define 10 different variants of the PPR motif found in plant proteins, in addition to the putative deaminase motif that is found at the C-terminus of many RNA-editing factors. We show that the super-helical RNA-binding surface of RNA-editing factors is potentially longer than previously recognised. We used the redefined motifs to develop accurate and consistent annotations of PPR sequences from 109 genomes. We report a high error rate in PPR gene models in many public plant proteomes, due to gene fusions and insertions of spurious introns. These consistently annotated datasets across a wide range of species are valuable resources for future comparative genomics studies, and an essential pre-requisite for accurate large-scale computational predictions of PPR targets. We have created a web portal () that provides open access to these resources for the community.

Abstract: On 12 April 2016, a 3-year-old male lion died in Ezhou zoo, Hubei province, China. Clinical symptoms include droopiness and anorexia several days before death, and no improvement was observed after symptomatic treatment. The body temperature of the lion, measured the night before its death, was 38.8 °C–38.9 °C. Necropsy findings included severe congestion and edema in the lungs, slight intestinal bloating and red residual urine in the bladder. Histopathological changes consisted of renal tubular necrosis and interstitial hemorrhage in the kidneys. In addition, there were pulmonary congestion, inflammatory infiltration and interstitial proliferation in the lungs, consistent with respiratory failure

Abstract: Cultivated peanut (Arachis hypogaea) is an allotetraploid with closely related subgenomes of a total size of approximately 2.7 Gb. This makes the assembly of chromosomal pseudomolecules very challenging. As a foundation to understanding the genome of cultivated peanut, we report the genome sequences of its diploid ancestors (Arachis duranensis and Arachis ipaensis). We show that these genomes are similar to cultivated peanut's A and B subgenomes and use them to identify candidate disease resistance genes, to guide tetraploid transcript assemblies and to detect genetic exchange between cultivated peanut's subgenomes. On the basis of remarkably high DNA identity of the A. ipaensis genome and the B subgenome of cultivated peanut and biogeographic evidence, we conclude that A. ipaensis may be a direct descendant of the same population that contributed the B subgenome to cultivated peanut.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Transition from a lizard-like to a snake-like body form is one of the most important transformations in reptilian evolution. The increasing number of sequenced reptilian genomes is enabling a deeper understanding of vertebrate evolution, although the genetic basis of the loss of limbs in reptiles remains enigmatic. Here we report genome sequencing, assembly, and annotation for the Asian glass lizard Ophisaurus gracilis, a limbless lizard species with an elongated snake-like body form. Addition of this species to the genome repository will provide an excellent resource for studying the genetic basis of limb loss and trunk elongation. FINDINGS: O. gracilis genome sequencing using the Illumina HiSeq2000 platform resulted in 274.20 Gbp of raw data that was filtered and assembled to a final size of 1.78 Gbp, comprising 6,717 scaffolds with N50 = 1.27 Mbp. Based on the k-mer estimated genome size of 1.71 Gbp, the assembly appears to be nearly 100% complete. A total of 19,513 protein-coding genes were predicted, and 884.06 Mbp of repeat sequences (approximately half of the genome) were annotated. The draft genome of O. gracilis has similar characteristics to both lizard and snake genomes. CONCLUSIONS: We report the first genome of a lizard from the family Anguidae, O. gracilis. This supplements currently available genetic and genomic resources for amniote vertebrates, representing a major increase in comparative genome data available for squamate reptiles in particular.

Abstract: Dinoflagellates are important components of marine ecosystems and essential coral symbionts, yet little is known about their genomes. We report here on the analysis of a high-quality assembly from the 1180-megabase genome of Symbiodinium kawagutii. We annotated protein-coding genes and identified Symbiodinium-specific gene families. No whole-genome duplication was observed, but instead we found active (retro)transposition and gene family expansion, especially in processes important for successful symbiosis with corals. We also documented genes potentially governing sexual reproduction and cyst formation, novel promoter elements, and a microRNA system potentially regulating gene expression in both symbiont and coral. We found biochemical complementarity between genomes of S. kawagutii and the anthozoan Acropora, indicative of host-symbiont coevolution, providing a resource for studying the molecular basis and evolution of coral symbiosis.

Abstract: Gossypium hirsutum has proven difficult to sequence owing to its complex allotetraploid (A(t)D(t)) genome. Here we produce a draft genome using 181-fold paired-end sequences assisted by fivefold BAC-to-BAC sequences and a high-resolution genetic map. In our assembly 88.5% of the 2,173-Mb scaffolds, which cover 89.6%similar to 96.7% of the A(t)D(t) genome, are anchored and oriented to 26 pseudochromosomes. Comparison of this Gossypium hirsutum A(t)D(t) genome with the already sequenced diploid Gossypium arboreum (AA) and Gossypium raimondii (DD) genomes revealed conserved gene order. Repeated sequences account for 67.2% of the AtDt genome, and transposable elements (TEs) originating from D-t seem more active than from A(t). Reduction in the A(t)D(t) genome size occurred after allopolyploidization. The A or A(t) genome may have undergone positive selection for fiber traits. Concerted evolution of different regulatory mechanisms for Cellulose synthase (CesA) and 1-Aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid oxidase1 and 3 (ACO1,3) may be important for enhanced fiber production in Gossypium hirsutum.

Short Title: The genome sequence of the orchid Phalaenopsis equestris
ISSN: 1546-1718
Abstract: Orchidaceae, renowned for its spectacular flowers and other reproductive and ecological adaptations, is one of the most diverse plant families. Here we present the genome sequence of the tropical epiphytic orchid Phalaenopsis equestris, a frequently used parent species for orchid breeding. P. equestris is the first plant with crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) for which the genome has been sequenced. Our assembled genome contains 29,431 predicted protein-coding genes. We find that contigs likely to be underassembled, owing to heterozygosity, are enriched for genes that might be involved in self-incompatibility pathways. We find evidence for an orchid-specific paleopolyploidy event that preceded the radiation of most orchid clades, and our results suggest that gene duplication might have contributed to the evolution of CAM photosynthesis in P. equestris. Finally, we find expanded and diversified families of MADS-box C/D-class, B-class AP3 and AGL6-class genes, which might contribute to the highly specialized morphology of orchid flowers.

Abstract: Mudskippers are amphibious fishes that have developed morphological and physiological adaptations to match their unique lifestyles. Here we perform whole-genome sequencing of four representative mudskippers to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying these adaptations. We discover an expansion of innate immune system genes in the mudskippers that may provide defence against terrestrial pathogens. Several genes of the ammonia excretion pathway in the gills have experienced positive selection, suggesting their important roles in mudskippers' tolerance to environmental ammonia. Some vision-related genes are differentially lost or mutated, illustrating genomic changes associated with aerial vision. Transcriptomic analyses of mudskippers exposed to air highlight regulatory pathways that are up-or down-regulated in response to hypoxia. The present study provides a valuable resource for understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying water-to-land transition of vertebrates.

Abstract: Using a whole-genome-sequencing approach to explore germplasm resources can serve as an important strategy for crop improvement, especially in investigating wild accessions that may contain useful genetic resources that have been lost during the domestication process. Here we sequence and assemble a draft genome of wild soybean and construct a recombinant inbred population for genotyping-by-sequencing and phenotypic analyses to identify multiple QTLs relevant to traits of interest in agriculture. We use a combination of de novo sequencing data from this work and our previous germplasm re-sequencing data to identify a novel ion transporter gene, GmCHX1, and relate its sequence alterations to salt tolerance. Rapid gain-of-function tests show the protective effects of GmCHX1 towards salt stress. This combination of whole-genome de novo sequencing, high-density-marker QTL mapping by re-sequencing and functional analyses can serve as an effective strategy to unveil novel genomic information in wild soybean to facilitate crop improvement.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: DNA methylation is an important type of epigenetic modification involved in gene regulation. Although strong DNA methylation at promoters is widely recognized to be associated with transcriptional repression, many aspects of DNA methylation remain not fully understood, including the quantitative relationships between DNA methylation and expression levels, and the individual roles of promoter and gene body methylation. RESULTS: Here we present an integrated analysis of whole-genome bisulfite sequencing and RNA sequencing data from human samples and cell lines. We find that while promoter methylation inversely correlates with gene expression as generally observed, the repressive effect is clear only on genes with a very high DNA methylation level. By means of statistical modeling, we find that DNA methylation is indicative of the expression class of a gene in general, but gene body methylation is a better indicator than promoter methylation. These findings are general in that a model constructed from a sample or cell line could accurately fit the unseen data from another. We further find that promoter and gene body methylation have minimal redundancy, and either one is sufficient to signify low expression. Finally, we obtain increased modeling power by integrating histone modification data with the DNA methylation data, showing that neither type of information fully subsumes the other. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that DNA methylation outside promoters also plays critical roles in gene regulation. Future studies on gene regulatory mechanisms and disease-associated differential methylation should pay more attention to DNA methylation at gene bodies and other non-promoter regions.

Abstract: Sheep (Ovis aries) are a major source of meat, milk, and fiber in the form of wool and represent a distinct class of animals that have a specialized digestive organ, the rumen, that carries out the initial digestion of plant material. We have developed and analyzed a high-quality reference sheep genome and transcriptomes from 40 different tissues. We identified highly expressed genes encoding keratin cross-linking proteins associated with rumen evolution. We also identified genes involved in lipid metabolism that had been amplified and/or had altered tissue expression patterns. This may be in response to changes in the barrier lipids of the skin, an interaction between lipid metabolism and wool synthesis, and an increased role of volatile fatty acids in ruminants compared with nonruminant animals.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Recently, many studies utilizing next generation sequencing have investigated plant evolution and domestication in annual crops. Peach, Prunus persica, is a typical perennial fruit crop that has ornamental and edible varieties. Unlike other fruit crops, cultivated peach includes a large number of phenotypes but few polymorphisms. In this study, we explore the genetic basis of domestication in peach and the influence of humans on its evolution. RESULTS: We perform large-scale resequencing of 10 wild and 74 cultivated peach varieties, including 9 ornamental, 23 breeding, and 42 landrace lines. We identify 4.6 million SNPs, a large number of which could explain the phenotypic variation in cultivated peach. Population analysis shows a single domestication event, the speciation of P. persica from wild peach. Ornamental and edible peach both belong to P. persica, along with another geographically separated subgroup, Prunus ferganensis. CONCLUSIONS: Our analyses enhance our knowledge of the domestication history of perennial fruit crops, and the dataset we generated could be useful for future research on comparative population genomics.

Abstract: The baiji, or Yangtze River dolphin (Lipotes vexillifer), is a flagship species for the conservation of aquatic animals and ecosystems in the Yangtze River of China; however, this species has now been recognized as functionally extinct. Here we report a high-quality draft genome and three re-sequenced genomes of L. vexillifer using Illumina short-read sequencing technology. Comparative genomic analyses reveal that cetaceans have a slow molecular clock and molecular adaptations to their aquatic lifestyle. We also find a significantly lower number of heterozygous single nucleotide polymorphisms in the baiji compared to all other mammalian genomes reported thus far. A reconstruction of the demographic history of the baiji indicates that a bottleneck occurred near the end of the last deglaciation, a time coinciding with a rapid decrease in temperature and the rise of eustatic sea level.

Abstract: Sacred lotus (Nelumbo nucifera) is an ornamental plant that is also used for food and medicine. This basal eudicot species is especially important from an evolutionary perspective, as it occupies a critical phylogenetic position in flowering plants. Here we report the draft genome of a wild strain of sacred lotus. The assembled genome is 792Mb, which is approximately 85-90% of genome size estimates. We annotated 392 Mb of repeat sequences and 36385 protein-coding genes within the genome. Using these sequence data, we constructed a phylogenetic tree and confirmed the basal location of sacred lotus within eudicots. Importantly, we found evidence for a relatively recent whole-genome duplication event; any indication of the ancient paleo-hexaploid event was, however, absent. Genomic analysis revealed evidence of positive selection within 28 embryo-defective genes and one annexin gene that may be related to the long-term viability of sacred lotus seed. We also identified a significant expansion of starch synthase genes, which probably elevated starch levels within the rhizome of sacred lotus. Sequencing this strain of sacred lotus thus provided important insights into the evolution of flowering plant and revealed genetic mechanisms that influence seed dormancy and starch synthesis.

Abstract: Most fruits in our daily diet are the products of domestication and breeding. Here we report a map of genome variation for a major fruit that encompasses similar to 3.6 million variants, generated by deep resequencing of 115 cucumber lines sampled from 3,342 accessions worldwide. Comparative analysis suggests that fruit crops underwent narrower bottlenecks during domestication than grain crops. We identified 112 putative domestication sweeps; 1 of these regions contains a gene involved in the loss of bitterness in fruits, an essential domestication trait of cucumber. We also investigated the genomic basis of divergence among the cultivated populations and discovered a natural genetic variant in a beta-carotene hydroxylase gene that could be used to breed cucumbers with enhanced nutritional value. The genomic history of cucumber evolution uncovered here provides the basis for future genomics-enabled breeding.

Abstract: Elite crop varieties usually fix alleles that occur at low frequencies within non-elite gene pools. Dissecting these alleles for desirable agronomic traits can be accomplished by comparing the genomes of elite varieties with those from non-elite populations. Here we deep-sequence six elite rice varieties and use two large control panels to identify elite variety tag single-nucleotide polymorphism alleles (ETASs). Guided by this preliminary analysis, we comprehensively characterize one protein-altering ETAS in the 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase gene of the IRAT104 upland rice variety. This allele displays a drastic frequency difference between upland and irrigated rice, and a selective sweep is observed around this allele. Functional analysis indicates that in upland rice, this allele is associated with significantly higher abscisic acid levels and denser lateral roots, suggesting its association with upland rice suitability. This report provides a potential strategy to mine rare, agronomically important alleles.

Abstract: Bread wheat (Triticum aestivum, AABBDD) is one of the most widely cultivated and consumed food crops in the world. However, the complex polyploid nature of its genome makes genetic and functional analyses extremely challenging. The A genome, as a basic genome of bread wheat and other polyploid wheats, for example, T. turgidum (AABB), T. timopheevii (AAGG) and T. zhukovskyi (AAGGA(m)A(m)), is central to wheat evolution, domestication and genetic improvement. The progenitor species of the A genome is the diploid wild einkorn wheat T. urartu, which resembles cultivated wheat more extensively than do Aegilops speltoides (the ancestor of the B genome) and Ae. tauschii (the donor of the D genome), especially in the morphology and development of spike and seed. Here we present the generation, assembly and analysis of a whole-genome shotgun draft sequence of the T. urartu genome. We identified protein-coding gene models, performed genome structure analyses and assessed its utility for analysing agronomically important genes and for developing molecular markers. Our T. urartu genome assembly provides a diploid reference for analysis of polyploid wheat genomes and is a valuable resource for the genetic improvement of wheat.

Abstract: Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, first isolated in 1957, are the preferred production host for many therapeutic proteins. Although genetic heterogeneity among CHO cell lines has been well documented, a systematic, nucleotide-resolution characterization of their genotypic differences has been stymied by the lack of a unifying genomic resource for CHO cells. Here we report a 2.4-Gb draft genome sequence of a female Chinese hamster, Cricetulus griseus, harboring 24,044 genes. We also resequenced and analyzed the genomes of six CHO cell lines from the CHO-K1, DG44 and CHO-S lineages. This analysis identified hamster genes missing in different CHO cell lines, and detected > 3.7 million single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), 551,240 indels and 7,063 copy number variations. Many mutations are located in genes with functions relevant to bioprocessing, such as apoptosis. The details of this genetic diversity highlight the value of the hamster genome as the reference upon which CHO cells can be studied and engineered for protein production.

Abstract: Large-scale next-generation sequencing (NGS)-based resequencing detects sequence variations, constructs evolutionary histories, and identifies phenotype-related genotypes. However, NGS-based resequencing studies generate extraordinarily large amounts of data, making computations difficult. Effective use and analysis of these data for NGS-based resequencing studies remains a difficult task for individual researchers. Here, we introduce ReSeqTools, a full-featured toolkit for NGS (Illumina sequencing)-based resequencing analysis, which processes raw data, interprets mapping results, and identifies and annotates sequence variations. ReSeqTools provides abundant scalable functions for routine resequencing analysis in different modules to facilitate customization of the analysis pipeline. ReSeqTools is designed to use compressed data files as input or output to save storage space and facilitates faster and more computationally efficient large-scale resequencing studies in a user-friendly manner. It offers abundant practical functions and generates useful statistics during the analysis pipeline, which significantly simplifies resequencing analysis. Its integrated algorithms and abundant sub-functions provide a solid foundation for special demands in resequencing projects. Users can combine these functions to construct their own pipelines for other purposes.

Abstract: We report the approximately 2.66-Gb genome sequence of a female Yunnan black goat. The sequence was obtained by combining short-read sequencing data and optical mapping data from a high-throughput whole-genome mapping instrument. The whole-genome mapping data facilitated the assembly of super-scaffolds >5x longer by the N50 metric than scaffolds augmented by fosmid end sequencing (scaffold N50 = 3.06 Mb, super-scaffold N50 = 16.3 Mb). Super-scaffolds are anchored on chromosomes based on conserved synteny with cattle, and the assembly is well supported by two radiation hybrid maps of chromosome 1. We annotate 22,175 protein-coding genes, most of which were recovered in the RNA-seq data of ten tissues. Comparative transcriptomic analysis of the primary and secondary follicles of a cashmere goat reveal 51 genes that are differentially expressed between the two types of hair follicles. This study, whose results will facilitate goat genomics, shows that whole-genome mapping technology can be used for the de novo assembly of large genomes.

Abstract: The Brassicaceae, including Arabidopsis thaliana and Brassica crops, is unmatched among plants in its wealth of genomic and functional molecular data and has long served as a model for understanding gene, genome, and trait evolution. However, genome information from a phylogenetic outgroup that is essential for inferring directionality of evolutionary change has been lacking. We therefore sequenced the genome of the spider flower (Tarenaya hassleriana) from the Brassicaceae sister family, the Cleomaceae. By comparative analysis of the two lineages, we show that genome evolution following ancient polyploidy and gene duplication events affect reproductively important traits. We found an ancient genome triplication in Tarenaya (Th-alpha) that is independent of the Brassicaceae-specific duplication (At-alpha) and nested Brassica (Br-alpha) triplication. To showcase the potential of sister lineage genome analysis, we investigated the state of floral developmental genes and show Brassica retains twice as many floral MADS (for minichromosome maintenance1, AGAMOUS, DEFICIENS and serum response factor) genes as Tarenaya that likely contribute to morphological diversity in Brassica. We also performed synteny analysis of gene families that confer self-incompatibility in Brassicaceae and found that the critical serine receptor kinase receptor gene is derived from a lineage-specific tandem duplication. The T. hassleriana genome will facilitate future research toward elucidating the evolutionary history of Brassicaceae genomes.

Abstract: Foxtail millet (Setaria italica), a member of the Poaceae grass family, is an important food and fodder crop in arid regions and has potential for use as a C(4) biofuel. It is a model system for other biofuel grasses, including switchgrass and pearl millet. We produced a draft genome ( approximately 423 Mb) anchored onto nine chromosomes and annotated 38,801 genes. Key chromosome reshuffling events were detected through collinearity identification between foxtail millet, rice and sorghum including two reshuffling events fusing rice chromosomes 7 and 9, 3 and 10 to foxtail millet chromosomes 2 and 9, respectively, that occurred after the divergence of foxtail millet and rice, and a single reshuffling event fusing rice chromosome 5 and 12 to foxtail millet chromosome 3 that occurred after the divergence of millet and sorghum. Rearrangements in the C(4) photosynthesis pathway were also identified.

Abstract: Rice is a staple crop that has undergone substantial phenotypic and physiological changes during domestication. Here we resequenced the genomes of 40 cultivated accessions selected from the major groups of rice and 10 accessions of their wild progenitors (Oryza rufipogon and Oryza nivara) to >15 x raw data coverage. We investigated genome-wide variation patterns in rice and obtained 6.5 million high-quality single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) after excluding sites with missing data in any accession. Using these population SNP data, we identified thousands of genes with significantly lower diversity in cultivated but not wild rice, which represent candidate regions selected during domestication. Some of these variants are associated with important biological features, whereas others have yet to be functionally characterized. The molecular markers we have identified should be valuable for breeding and for identifying agronomically important genes in rice.

Abstract: Preferential accumulation of transposable elements (TEs), particularly long terminal repeat retrotransposons (LTR-RTs), in recombination-suppressed pericentromeric regions seems to be a general pattern of TE distribution in flowering plants. However, whether such a pattern was formed primarily by preferential TE insertions into pericentromeric regions or by selection against TE insertions into euchromatin remains obscure. We recently investigated TE insertions in 31 resequenced wild and cultivated soybean (Glycine max) genomes and detected 34,154 unique nonreference TE insertions mappable to the reference genome. Our data revealed consistent distribution patterns of the nonreference LTR-RT insertions and those present in the reference genome, whereas the distribution patterns of the nonreference DNA TE insertions and the accumulated ones were significantly different. The densities of the nonreference LTR-RT insertions were found to negatively correlate with the rates of local genetic recombination, but no significant correlation between the densities of nonreference DNA TE insertions and the rates of local genetic recombination was detected. These observations suggest that distinct insertional preferences were primary factors that resulted in different levels of effectiveness of purifying selection, perhaps as an effect of local genomic features, such as recombination rates and gene densities that reshaped the distribution patterns of LTR-RTs and DNA TEs in soybean.

Abstract: Tumor heterogeneity presents a challenge for inferring clonal evolution and driver gene identification. Here, we describe a method for analyzing the cancer genome at a single-cell nucleotide level. To perform our analyses, we first devised and validated a high-throughput whole-genome single-cell sequencing method using two lymphoblastoid cell line single cells. We then carried out whole-exome single-cell sequencing of 90 cells from a JAK2-negative myeloproliferative neoplasm patient. The sequencing data from 58 cells passed our quality control criteria, and these data indicated that this neoplasm represented a monoclonal evolution. We further identified essential thrombocythemia (ET)-related candidate mutations such as SESN2 and NTRK1, which may be involved in neoplasm progression. This pilot study allowed the initial characterization of the disease-related genetic architecture at the single-cell nucleotide level. Further, we established a single-cell sequencing method that opens the way for detailed analyses of a variety of tumor types, including those with high genetic complex between patients.

Abstract: Tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) is a major crop plant and a model system for fruit development. Solanum is one of the largest angiosperm genera and includes annual and perennial plants from diverse habitats. Here we present a high-quality genome sequence of domesticated tomato, a draft sequence of its closest wild relative, Solanum pimpinellifolium, and compare them to each other and to the potato genome (Solanum tuberosum). The two tomato genomes show only 0.6% nucleotide divergence and signs of recent admixture, but show more than 8% divergence from potato, with nine large and several smaller inversions. In contrast to Arabidopsis, but similar to soybean, tomato and potato small RNAs map predominantly to gene-rich chromosomal regions, including gene promoters. The Solanum lineage has experienced two consecutive genome triplications: one that is ancient and shared with rosids, and a more recent one. These triplications set the stage for the neofunctionalization of genes controlling fruit characteristics, such as colour and fleshiness.

Abstract: Whereas breeders have exploited diversity in maize for yield improvements, there has been limited progress in using beneficial alleles in undomesticated varieties. Characterizing standing variation in this complex genome has been challenging, with only a small fraction of it described to date. Using a population genetics scoring model, we identified 55 million SNPs in 103 lines across pre-domestication and domesticated Zea mays varieties, including a representative from the sister genus Tripsacum. We find that structural variations are pervasive in the Z. mays genome and are enriched at loci associated with important traits. By investigating the drivers of genome size variation, we find that the larger Tripsacum genome can be explained by transposable element abundance rather than an allopolyploid origin. In contrast, intraspecies genome size variation seems to be controlled by chromosomal knob content. There is tremendous overlap in key gene content in maize and Tripsacum, suggesting that adaptations from Tripsacum (for example, perennialism and frost and drought tolerance) can likely be integrated into maize.

Abstract: Chinese hamster ovary (CHO)-derived cell lines are the preferred host cells for the production of therapeutic proteins. Here we present a draft genomic sequence of the CHO-K1 ancestral cell line. The assembly comprises 2.45 Gb of genomic sequence, with 24,383 predicted genes. We associate most of the assembled scaffolds with 21 chromosomes isolated by microfluidics to identify chromosomal locations of genes. Furthermore, we investigate genes involved in glycosylation, which affect therapeutic protein quality, and viral susceptibility genes, which are relevant to cell engineering and regulatory concerns. Homologs of most human glycosylation-associated genes are present in the CHO-K1 genome, although 141 of these homologs are not expressed under exponential growth conditions. Many important viral entry genes are also present in the genome but not expressed, which may explain the unusual viral resistance property of CHO cell lines. We discuss how the availability of this genome sequence may facilitate genome-scale science for the optimization of biopharmaceutical protein production.

Abstract: We report a large-scale analysis of the patterns of genome-wide genetic variation in soybeans. We re-sequenced a total of 17 wild and 14 cultivated soybean genomes to an average of approximately x5 depth and >90% coverage using the Illumina Genome Analyzer II platform. We compared the patterns of genetic variation between wild and cultivated soybeans and identified higher allelic diversity in wild soybeans. We identified a high level of linkage disequilibrium in the soybean genome, suggesting that marker-assisted breeding of soybean will be less challenging than map-based cloning. We report linkage disequilibrium block location and distribution, and we identified a set of 205,614 tag SNPs that may be useful for QTL mapping and association studies. The data here provide a valuable resource for the analysis of wild soybeans and to facilitate future breeding and quantitative trait analysis.
